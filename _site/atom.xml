   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The fourth in a series of posts by Dr Mark McKerracher on the origins of agriculture.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every now and again agricultural archaeology and related disciplines hit the headlines. This latest post was inspired by a couple of pieces of new research, which the BBC flagged a couple of years ago, and which indicate a hitherto unexpected sophisication of farming and diet in prehistory. And, better yet, the original research article (Saul et al. 2013)is open access so you can see it for yourself &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0070583&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The results are from ‘The Baltic Foragers and Early Farmers Ceramic Research Project’, in which Mesolithic and Neolithic pottery from modern Denmark and northern Germany were examined for food residues. Now, I’d heard of lipid residue analysis before, but in this case the evidence comes from phytoliths preserved in charred residues on the pottery. Literally, phytolith translates as something like ‘plant-stone’: they are the remains of an insoluble silica that gets deposited amongst cells in the living plant, and survives even once the plant itself has been burned away. Usefully for us, they can often be identified to family, genus or even species level, allowing us some insight into plant use and ecology (see Cappers &amp;amp; Neef 2012 p.130 for a good brief summary). In this case, the phytoliths point to Alliaria petiolata (M. Bieb) Cavara &amp;amp; Grande – more commonly known as garlic mustard. The context suggests culinary use; the plant gives a strong taste but has negligible nutritional value; hence, those prehistoric chaps and chapesses were apparently spicing their food, simply for the delectable taste. Yum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And why not, after all? Why shouldn’t hunter-gatherers and early farmers have been concerned to eat something tastier than hulled wheat, hazelnuts and crab apples? For me, though, this raises the question of gathering vs. cultivation – i.e. were they deliberately growing spices, in a kind of herb garden set-up? This might sound fanciful for the Neolithic but, again, if you can invent agriculture, why not herb gardens?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And talking of Neolithic inventiveness, here’s the second piece of news that interested me: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-23314510&quot;&gt;“Neolithic farmers used manure on crops”&lt;/a&gt;. This one strikes rather closer to home, not just because it came shortly after Dung Awareness Day, but because the work was led by my colleagues, elders and betters at Oxford University. The School of Archaeology even issued its own press release. Neolithic plant remains from across Europe were subjected to stable isotope analysis, and the results indicate that certain crops were manured – a means of fertilisation whose usage wasn’t previously known as early as this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ‘certain crops’ bit is highly significant, since it implies that the Neolithic farmers were selecting those crops that they thought would benefit the most from manuring, leaving the hardier types to fend for themselves. The lead researcher Dr Amy Bogaard, quoting to the BBC, draws out the wider significance of these findings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;These results point to a different kind of farming where they were making fixed investments in land that they intended to hang onto and pass on to future generations…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is cutting-edge stuff, and excitingly we can expect more good things to come, because Dr Bogaard is running an impressive ERC-funded four-year project investigating “The Agricultural Origins of Urban Civilization”, which now has its own &lt;a href=&quot;https://agricurb.com/&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; that is well worth keeping an eye on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper has now been published – it’s one of those where the number of authors exceeds the number of pages, demonstrating the wealth of expertise behind these results: Bogaard et al. 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the moral of the story – if any – is that you should never underestimate prehistoric farmers.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The third in a series of posts by Dr Mark McKerracher on the origins of agriculture.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The writing of this post was only ever a matter timing – a question of ‘when’ not ‘if’. Once I’d started an occasional series of blog posts about the origins of agriculture, I knew I’d have to write one (or several) about the very beginnings, the true origins – the first farming in the history of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that time has come, and we shall reach back through the mists of time towards the earliest farmers (and, to be precise, I’m only thinking about arable farming this time)… prompted by an unexpected link, posted on the Association for Environmental Archaeology’s Facebook page, and a recently purchased new book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, the book:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cappers, R.T.J. &amp;amp; Neef, R. (2012). &lt;em&gt;Handbook of Plant Palaeoecology&lt;/em&gt; (Barkhuis, Groningen).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This splendid volume, lavishly illustrated and still surrounded by an aura of new-book-smell, is a thorough guide to plant palaeoecology – or, as some (like me) prefer to call it, archaeobotany. It discusses everything from taxonomy, biology and ecology to preservation, identification and interpretation. Examples are drawn from various sources, in particular the authors’ fieldwork in Egypt, where walnut bark is apparently used for “cleaning teeth and reddening lips”. See the photo on page 12 of such bark for sale at a Cairo market, advertised as “Lady Toots-brush” – surely the perfect name for a pop diva.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I digress. I recommend this book and may come back to it in future posts, but its main relevance to this post is that it has a section entitled “Modelling the dawn of farming” (pp.375-80), a handy summary guide to, well, the dawn of farming. It’s a pretty complex area of debate, and not my particular area of expertise, but some basic points are worthy of note:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The period in question is the Neolithic, more specifically the self-explanatory “Pre-Pottery Neolithic” period, over 10,000 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The area in question may broadly be described as Western Asia, with particular importance being commonly attached to the biblical lands of the so-called “Fertile Crescent”, running from the valley of the Jordan, north up the Levantine coast, bending around south-east Turkey and Syria, and following the Euphrates and Tigris down to the Persian Gulf.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;illustration&quot;&gt;


&lt;a href=&quot;/images/fcmap.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fcmap.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;span&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Norman Einstein, based on a similar map from the 1994 edition of the &lt;em&gt;Encyclopedia Britannica&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=471913&quot;&gt;CC BY-SA 3.0&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The basic process at work is something like this: hunter-gatherers gathering wild food plants and sowing their seeds, and harvesting the result, and so on; this proto-agricultural process, somewhere between wildlife management and full-blown farming, resulted in the domestication of crops – whereby certain (genetic) characteristics offered a competitive advantage under cultivation, but not in the wild. For example, in the wild it’s advantageous to have good seed dispersal mechanisms, to increase chances of germination in the next generation. But under cultivation, this is disadvantageous: successful reproduction comes not from shattering your seeds all over the place, but from having your seeds harvested and resown as seed-corn. For an excellent, informed discussion of crop domestication see Fuller 2007.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, this topic raises a number of pressing questions. Radiocarbon-dated crop remains indicate, on current evidence, that the cultivation and domestication of, e.g. wheat, occurred first of all around the Levant – but it’s less clear whether the same ‘discovery’ occurred at other places independently, or whether everyone else got the idea from the Levant. The latter model is a bit – dare I lapse into the vernacular? – a bit old school. A bit “diffusionist”, as they say on the street. But to support the other model, the ‘multiple independent origins’ model, you’d need to find and date other domesticated crop remains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now to that article that I was led to unexpectedly via Facebook: “Farming Was So Nice, It Was Invented At Least Twice”, on ScienceNOW, reporting on an original research paper in Science itself (Riehl et al. 2013).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The item reports new research that supports the ‘multiple independent origins’ model: a long, well-dated sequence of plant remains from a site in Iran, suggesting cultivation and domestication not so long after its more westerly Levantine counterpart, and apparently independently invented. Suggestive, but not conclusive – partly because radiocarbon dates aren’t quite precise enough. If you’ve got access to &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, another paper in the same issue by George Willcox helps to put all this in perspective (Willcox 2013).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, my series of posts on Rounded Globe has finally scratch-ploughed the surface of the very origins of agriculture. There’s clearly a fascinating and epic story waiting to be told here, with ambitious new research constantly building up our picture (did I mention genetic profiling?), and if/when I have time I’d love to explore this all in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>What is a Professor?</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Herb Childress turns his gaze from the supply of knowledge to the people behind it&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her son was murdered, and she began to study sociology as a way to understand the world her son had travelled in. She now teaches at a small college, a 5/5 load, trying to bring other students to understanding of the duties of friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He grew up in wheat country, not understanding as a child that the grain elevators and railroad tracks, along with bringing a few jobs in, also took enormous resources away for pennies. “I never heard the word taco until I was twenty-five,” he said. “I never had one until I was twenty-seven.” He now teaches others how to read—and to be curious about—the world around them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He has published nearly 500 articles in chemistry, and his new college lured him away from a prior position with a lab fund of two million dollars and a job for his wife. He makes two dozen international trips a year, and has not booked his own travel in twenty years. He brings undergraduate students into his lab teams, working alongside postdocs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I decided when I was twelve,” she said, “that I either had to go to college or I’d end up like my family.” She recently used vacation days to attend the funeral of her brother, who’d died of an overdose, following on the history of their father’s similar demise years earlier. She did not tell her faculty colleagues why she was away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She graduated from high school at 17, her BS in mechanical engineering at 21, her PhD in mechanical engineering at 25, and was tenured at a top-tier research university at 31. She brings her school millions of dollars a year in research funding, and has been responsible for dozens of new PhDs from her research group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He works in the registrar’s office at another college, and also DJs on the weekends. He collects international rock music, and once burned a CD of Vietnamese psychedelia for a colleague in his office. He teaches Intro to Sociology at a nearby community college, on their late-night shift from 11:30 pm to 2:30 am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How little we know of those people who stand in front of us. If we become one of them, how little we know of our colleagues. As long as we hold our generic label of “professor” — as opaque a term as “barista” or “waitress” or “soldier,” a nameless servant who does their duty — we are permitted to not know the person. Education can be thought of merely as packets of information being shifted back and forth between invisible entities, like automated stock trading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Student,” of course, is equally opaque. But because of their youth and naivete, they’re often more willing to tell us their stories. I had a young woman in tears in my office, believing (incorrectly) that she wasn’t capable of doing the work that her college demanded. “I know I’m only here because of field hockey,” she wept. I had a young man in class who was going to college in order to make enough money to buy back the farm that had been in his family for five generations, that his father had been forced to sell. I had varsity athletes who told me of the galvanized steel pails around the weight room that were there within handy reach, for them to vomit into from overexertion and dehydration in their pre-dawn workouts. I had a student tell me about his mother calling from Taiwan every Saturday morning to find out if he was dating a nice Chinese girl yet, to tell him once again how it would be her death and shame if her grandchildren spoke another language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do we leave our homes and become something other? Why do we stand on the far shore and try to welcome various of the refugees escaping their homelands? Why do we become so obsessed by fruit-fly digestive chemistry, or a nineteenth-century political economist, or the ways that teenagers use their communities, that we spend much of a career in isolation, pursuing those ghosts? The answers are as diverse as we are, too often hidden away even from ourselves. If we explored, and shared, the motives and dreams and fears that drive us, perhaps we would do better at the human work of teaching and learning.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Enchantment of Learning</title>
   <link href="http://roundedglobe.github.io/the-enchantment-of-learning/"/>
   <updated>2016-04-28T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://roundedglobe.github.io/the-enchantment-of-learning</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Patrick Curry offers this short essay on a subject dear to the heart of our Rounded Globe project, a draft of part of a forthcoming longer paper on the same theme.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wonder of learning, the delight of discovering what (it turns out) you wanted to know, the joy of a new world to inhabit, seen through other than your own habitual eyes – these things are so undervalued in our current educational institutions that we need to take a moment to remind ourselves of what we are talking about. Here are three examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Niccolò Machiavelli has been exiled from Florence to his family farm, and in a letter of 10th December 1513 writes to his friend Francesco Vettori:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;On the coming of evening, I return to my house and enter my study, and at the door I take off the day’s clothing, covered with mud and dust, and put on garments regal and courtly; and reclothed appropriately, I enter the ancient courts of men of antiquity where, affectionately received, I partake of that food which only is mine and for which I was born, where I am not too timid to speak with them and ask them the reasons for their actions; and they in their courtesy answer me; and for four hours of time I feel no weariness, I forget every trouble, I do not fear poverty, death does not dismay me; I give myself over entirely to them. (Quoted in White: 183-84)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This passage is usually assumed by modern scholars to be a mere humanist trope, a literary flourish. It is both more respectful and more economical, however, to assume that Machiavelli meant exactly what he said, and that what he describes is just what happened. Or are we too jaded to believe it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In another example, in 1934, after a time of sleeping rough in his long walk across Europe, the great travel writer Patrick Leigh Fermor found himself a guest of the British Consul in Sofia. He luxuriated in the hot baths, clean linen and fine food, but ‘Best of all,’ he said, ‘the &lt;em&gt;Encyclopaedia Britannica&lt;/em&gt;; I leapt at it like a panther’ (Fermor: 8).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently still, another writer, Eva Hoffman, recalls emerging from her fortnightly trip to the local library in her Warsaw neighbourhood, the interior of which was ‘a space of mystery and magic, on whose threshold I stand a humble acolyte’: ‘I come out, usually into the dim evening streets, enchanted with what awaits me, and as soon as I come home, I pounce on one of the volumes’ (Hoffman: 26). (Note the pantherine resonance with Leigh Fermor; the soul is hungry for living knowledge, and only that can satisfy it.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sort of relationship with learning – enchanted, and passionately so – is the true benchmark for understanding, appreciating and encouraging its wonder. Let me try to tease out some of the dynamics at work. One is the seriousness of play: improvised but not random, intentional but not goal-directed, and relational, involving other beings, of whatever kind, whether physically present or imaginally. When it takes place free from any attempt to direct or manipulate or use it, play is fundamental to the way we learn how to be ourselves as well as how others tick, how to create and innovate and, perhaps most importantly, how to learn at all. The enchantment resulting from play leads you deeper into whatever you’re doing, which in turn generates a deeper enchantment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another aspect of the enchantment of learning is the intrinsic value of what is being learned. As John Henry Newman insisted long ago in &lt;em&gt;The Idea of a University&lt;/em&gt;, ‘any kind of knowledge, if it be really such, is its own reward’. It is valuable not for its instrumental or exchange-value, in order to attain some other goal, no matter what, but, he wrote, ‘for what its very presence does for us’ (Newman 1982 [1853]: 77, 78). And the experience of that presence is one of wonder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an essay of the same title, Simon Leys has restated Newman’s thesis, writing that ‘a university is a place where scholars seek truth, pursue and transmit knowledge for knowledge’s sake – irrespective of the consequences, implications and utility of the endeavour.’ However anachronistic or impractical it may appear, it is necessary, now more than ever, to insist on this humanist ideal, even if only so we can realise how far we have fallen. As Leys says, ‘When a university yields to the utilitarian temptation, it betrays its vocation and sells its soul’, without which it cannot fulfil its very &lt;em&gt;raison d’être&lt;/em&gt; (Leyes: 463, 464).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another dynamic is metaphor. Metaphor is the life-blood of learning, and of the humanities in particular, because there can be no empathic, imaginative or narrative understanding without understanding-&lt;em&gt;as&lt;/em&gt;: without the tensive truth of being, at one and the same time, who you are as the reader, listener, viewer or whatever, and simultaneously (in defiance of Aristotle’s logical laws) as the other person, or indeed thing, you are hearing, watching or reading, or about whom you are reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science has different goals: explanation, prediction, mastery (see the work of Mary Midgley, Paul Feyerabend and many others, including my own &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.patrickcurry.co.uk/papers/Rio%20paper%20-%20Feb%202015.pdf&quot;&gt;‘Defending the Humanities in a Time of Ecocide’&lt;/a&gt;). Accordingly, it may start in wonder but can only progress, in its own terms, by trying to ‘resolve’ or otherwise eliminate explicit metaphor, ambiguity and paradox. To quote the Nobel Prize-winning scientist Sir Peter Medawar (in a passage I find quite chilling):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As science advances, particular facts are comprehended within, and therefore in a sense annihilated by, general statements of steadily increasing explanatory power and compass… In all science we are being progressively relieved of the &lt;em&gt;burden&lt;/em&gt; of singular instances, the &lt;em&gt;tyranny&lt;/em&gt; of the particular. (Quoted in Feyerabend: 250, 251; my emphases)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is valued in this case is increasingly generic abstraction, whose ultimate model is mathematics. Contrast this worldview with that of Freya Stark, the great travel writer and essayist, who affirms that ‘truth is &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; average. Since there is not one single thing in the world exactly like another, the very essence of truth is that it leaps across averages to the particular…’ (Stark 2013 [1948]: 81; her emphasis). Certainly this kind of truth is essential to enchantment, whose ‘magic’ is always to be found in and as the ‘concrete’. Indeed, I see it as essential to life itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where metaphor comes in. As its theorist Paul Ricoeur (2003) put it, metaphor discovers as it creates, and makes as it finds. And it does so together with an other, whoever that may be. This is not truth as accurate representation, nor as deductive syllogism, but as relationship and its effects. Hence Weber’s definition of truth, respecting its wildness and autonomy: ‘only that which &lt;em&gt;wants&lt;/em&gt; to be true for all those who &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; the truth’ (quoted in Schaff: 118; original emphases). The contrast with the starveling captive of modern power-knowledge could hardly be clearer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This mode is not about knowing and manipulating an item. It is participatory, both affecting the other party or parties and being affected by them, and the actual individuals involved are of paramount importance. It is above all from and in relationship with a particular (‘concrete’) teacher that one learns, and one does so in a way that includes but transcends any methods or propositional content. This relationality extends to communities of teaching and learning – some of whose members (as in the experience of Machiavelli) may not be present in the narrowly physical sense – and their various traditions. And it leaves thinking as only a process that does not already know, although it may sense, its conclusion in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was lucky enough to have this kind of experience in Gregory Bateson’s classes at the University of California (Santa Cruz) in the mid-70s. It comprised learning new things about both the world and myself, and with each one, a significantly new world and self came into being. But not only that; the excitement was both subtler and more sweeping. To borrow Bateson’s own terms, I was learning how to learn. And that only happened in his presence, in a way that cannot be reduced to concepts alone. Yet I was also aware of the presence, not literally but unmistakably nonetheless, of those from whom he had learned, and learned how to think: Blake, Lamark, his father the scientist William Bateson and, not least, the author of &lt;em&gt;The Book of Job&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Tombs in Beowulf</title>
   <link href="http://roundedglobe.github.io/tombs-in-beowulf/"/>
   <updated>2016-04-21T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://roundedglobe.github.io/tombs-in-beowulf</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Howard M. R. Williams reports on his recent Grosvenor Lunchtime Lecture, organized by the Department of History and Archaeology of Chester University, “Tombs in ‘Beowulf’.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I began my talk by discussing the many material dimensions to the poem &lt;em&gt;Beowulf&lt;/em&gt; – halls, feasting and martial material culture, and burial mounds. I then introduced the challenge and problems of reading history and archaeology from the poem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The poem does indeed shed light on an historical ‘reality,’ but only in the broadest of terms. It reveals the widespread deployment of dimensions of mortuary practices of the 5th-10th centuries in Britain and Scandinavia, including furnished graves, ship-burial, cremation practices and burial mounds. The poem’s fascination with imagined pasts is also revealed in the archaeological record, namely the widespread interest in inserting early medieval graves into prehistoric and Roman monuments before and alongside the widespread adoption of Christian burial traditions and mortuary geographies. Also significant is the way in which the poem reveals a perception of landscape that chimes with the emerging Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of the 7th century onwards. Rather than providing a direct window onto a legendary Migration Period, the poem reveals the rich power of material cultures and landscape in constructing social memories and worldviews for Christian secular elites in the later Anglo-Saxon period, in which the pagan past had a powerful role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;illustration smallimg left&quot;&gt;


&lt;a href=&quot;/images/hw2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/hw2.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;span&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The 8th-century Anglo-Saxon crypt at Repton. This may well reflect the kind of environment the Beowulf-poet was trying to evoke as the dwelling of the dragon guarding treasure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turning to the funerals within Beowulf, we must guard ourselves from the seductive desire to equate the poem with the furnished ‘princely’ graves of the 7th century exclusively (including Taplow, Sutton Hoo Mounds 1, 2 and 17, and Prittlewell). A more fruitful approach is to examine the widespread evidence of varying uses of boats and ships in mortuary practices across northern Europe that provide the background to Scyld Scefing’s funeral at the beginning of the poem. Archaeology can not only shed light on the material world of tombs that created inspiration for the poet, but help us to understand the significance of tombs in the poem itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have recently published an essay in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-lives-of-prehistoric-monuments-in-iron-age-roman-and-medieval-europe-9780198724605?cc=il&amp;amp;lang=en&amp;amp;&quot;&gt;collected volume&lt;/a&gt; presenting a fresh perspective on the significance of the dragon’s mound in &lt;em&gt;Beowulf&lt;/em&gt;. I argued that the archaeological certainty of a Neolithic megalithic monument being depicted in the epic poem is something of an allusion created by archaeologists and a desire to fix a categorical material classification to the monument in the poem. I therefore explored the idea that the monument was a ‘counter-tomb’ with its own biography within the poem itself. As such, it might have been regarded, more than a description of a prehistoric tomb, as a literary antithesis to the subterranean and semi-subterranean crypts containing the graves of kings and saints in middle Anglo-Saxon England. In both regards, my point was to try to query an equation between the poem and the archaeological record in terms of any single period, place or practice. The poem does not preserve traces of a pagan past; rather, it draws on the material world to convey a variety of temporalities and materialities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;illustration smallimg right&quot;&gt;


&lt;a href=&quot;/images/hw3.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/hw3.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;span&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The Asthall barrow, Oxfordshire: a 7th-century cremation with imported items covered by a prominent burial mound. In broad terms, such funerary practices mirror those afforded to the hero of ‘Beowulf’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sandwiched between my discussion in the lecture of Scyld Scefing’s boat-funeral and the dragon’s stone barrow, I also explored the tomb of Beowulf himself in the poem. After his death fighting the dragon, Beowulf is cremated on a headland, close to the dragon’s mound. His pyre is decked with the dragon’s treasure and the mound raised over the pyre subsequently serves as a waymarker for mariners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suggested that this funeral needs renewed attention. Scholars need to re-engage with the importance of cremation followed by mound-building – as described in the poem – as a widespread practice in Early Medieval Europe. Rather than trying to pin down a single source of inspiration for the poet, we can more profitably apply our transformed archaeological and anthropological understanding of cremation practices themselves worldwide, and in the early Middle Ages in particular, to the poem. In other words, in place of an attempt to find through archaeology the material ‘reality’ behind the poem, a combination of archaeology and a reading of the poem can demonstrate the varying and complex efficacies of cremation performances followed by mound-building in the construction of social memory and for myth making strategies among early medieval communities. Here lies the direction for future research…&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beverley Southgate criticizes the representation of the work of the historian in Bryn Hammond’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://roundedglobe.com/book/54f6f692a26359d553f3348e/Voices%20from%20the%20Twelfth-Century%20Steppe&quot;&gt;Voices from the Twelfth-Century Steppe&lt;/a&gt;, recently published by &lt;a href=&quot;http://roundedglobe.com&quot;&gt;Rounded Globe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bryn Hammond provides a specific study that explicitly raises questions of wider historiographical interest. Her primary concern is to excite more people about what might seem (to a Eurocentric historian) quite an esoteric subject: epic records from the steppes of the Mongol empire. I am certainly not competent to comment on that subject-matter; but the author indicates throughout how her material impinges on the more general question of history’s relationship with fiction – and that is something I discussed in my &lt;em&gt;History Meets Fiction&lt;/em&gt; (2009), and is a subject that continues to interest me. My main argument here is that Hammond over-estimates the difference between the two genres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an historical novelist, she approves of the approach to history adopted by the authors of her main text, the &lt;em&gt;Secret History of the Mongols&lt;/em&gt;. As with other ‘secret histories’ (such as date back at least to Procopius in the sixth century), this records aspects of the past that some might have preferred forgotten. It incorporates inscriptions and oral traditions that embrace personal memories, and it is variously written in both prose and verse. These characteristics, Hammond insists, mark it out – distinguish it – from conventional histories, and show it as more akin to her own compositions as a novelist. For historians in her view are far more constrained within the limits and limitations of their empirical evidence; they don’t indulge in speculation or ‘conjecture’, since their ultimate concern is to present a coherent narrative of ‘what actually happened’. Such constrained histories, she accuses, amount to little more than ‘an impoverished string of facts’ (50-1); and one might be reminded here of Dickens’ Thomas Gradgrind in &lt;em&gt;Hard Times&lt;/em&gt;, and his obsession with ‘facts’ at the expense of imagination or any sense of ‘wonder’. That image of the ‘dryasdust’ historian seems still to live on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But surely this is a caricature of what historians actually do and aim to do? No less than novelists, their job is not just to collect ‘facts’ – or remnants of the past that constitute evidence – but to make sense of those building-blocks, by incorporating them into a narrative, a story that for them rings ‘true’. That story will not be found in their materials, but must be imposed upon them. For there is no inherent ‘meaning’ in the past, or in what survives from it: it is either historians or novelists – or anyone else – who are needed to give it any meaning. In other words, since ‘the past’ is irretrievably gone, and beyond anyone’s ability to access directly, it makes no sense to talk of any ‘true’ representations of it; there is just no way of testing ‘the truth’ of any claims made, either by historians or by novelists. Both are engaged in imaginatively constructing an edifice that stands for the moment, but may need modification in the light of new materials or changed perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it really makes no sense to claim, as Bryn Hammond does, that novelists are in some sense more free to make of the past what they will – not, that is, if they claim to be ‘&lt;em&gt;historical&lt;/em&gt;’ novelists who base their work on what actually happened in the past. And Hammond certainly seems concerned to retrieve something of that past – claiming indeed that novelists can do that more effectively than historians, inasmuch as they can take their time to understand texts in their own terms. Having no axe to grind, novelists can take an interest, not only in what actually happened, but in what might have happened and what nearly happened (108). They can, she writes, follow ‘the sense behind the scenes’ (21), examining leads that might not have been taken up in real life; they can read between the lines, and make psychologically based inferences that would lie beyond the scope of conventional histories. (These include the exploration of such abstractions as Mongols’ self-imaginings and self-understanding (50-1), the accommodation of ‘irrational behaviour’, ‘thoughts and feelings’, and ‘people’s inner lives’ (69-70).) And importantly novelists become able in this way to open up sight of possible alternatives – which makes them better able to avoid the appearance of ‘inevitability’, and ‘restore indeterminacy, contingency, accident’ (31).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I have to say that, as Bryn Hammond describes what she endeavours to do as a novelist, it all sounds rather familiar – as being just what contemporary historians are doing. Indeed, I have recently been reading Lytton Strachey’s (early twentieth-century) account of the psychological complexities and personal inconsistencies in the characters of Victorians whose lives he was writing; historians, he writes, should aim at such ‘&lt;em&gt;imaginative comprehension&lt;/em&gt;’ of people in the past as would enable us to ‘move with ease among their familiar essential &lt;em&gt;feelings&lt;/em&gt;’. So attempts by historians to understand ‘inner lives’ is nothing new. (And surely, even Thucydides in the fifth century BC had to try to understand his subjects’ psychology in order to assess their motivations and put authentic-sounding words into their mouths?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, then, Bryn Hammond seems unaware of more recent historiographical developments, in terms of which ‘history’ is perceived, no longer as a ‘science’, but as an ‘artform’. That implies recognition that historians are required to use their &lt;em&gt;imaginations&lt;/em&gt; to create their various stories about the past. Those stories, like those of novelists, will be based on evidence from the past, but must inevitably go beyond the empirical; they will be subjective attempts to impose meaning from a particular standpoint – so they will be admittedly contingent and provisional, with due recognition of the possibility of alternatives; and they will be replaceable (and no doubt replaced) in due course. And they will, further – in defiance of Hammond’s characterisation – take due account of &lt;em&gt;discontinuities&lt;/em&gt;: there has been much criticism lately of those smooth, supposedly all-embracing narratives that contrive to ‘normalise’ and comfort readers rather than unsettle them. (See e.g. Primo Levi, Claude Lanzmann, and Saul Friedländer on the Holocaust, and more generally Hayden White and other theorists.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As introduced by Bryn Hammond, then, the &lt;em&gt;Secret History of the Mongols&lt;/em&gt; can be taken as an example of what ‘history’ should be: written in both prose and poetry, it portrays not only external acts, but also internal ‘mental and emotional states’; it is concerned with conveying psychological insights as much as describing physical events with empirically based evidence. It is small wonder that three of its earlier commentators, approved by Hammond herself, are &lt;em&gt;historians&lt;/em&gt; whose methodology, as she admits, exactly parallels her own (109).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To conclude: both author and publisher are to be congratulated on bringing this subject, with its attendant historiographical issues, to a much wider readership in an easily accessible form; and I hope that what they have provided will form a convenient platform for further discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Spirit of Mordor</title>
   <link href="http://roundedglobe.github.io/the-spirit-of-Mordor/"/>
   <updated>2016-03-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://roundedglobe.github.io/the-spirit-of-Mordor</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To celebrate Tolkien reading day, Tom Hillman discusses the Old English word&lt;/em&gt; Morþorhete &lt;em&gt;and the Spirit of Mordor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day after Sam rescues Frodo from the tower of Cirith Ungol, two orcs, an Uruk and a smaller tracker, nearly catch them, but a fight breaks out between them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The big orc, spear in hand, leapt after him. But the tracker, springing behind a stone, put an arrow in his eye as he ran up, and he fell with a crash. The other ran off across the valley and disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For a while the hobbits sat in silence. At length Sam stirred. ‘Well I call that neat as neat,’ he said. ‘If this nice friendliness would spread about in Mordor, half our trouble would be over.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‘Quietly, Sam,’ Frodo whispered. ‘There may be others about. We have evidently had a very narrow escape, and the hunt was hotter on our tracks than we guessed. But that is the spirit of Mordor, Sam; and it has spread to every corner of it. Orcs have always behaved like that, or so all tales say, when they are on their own. But you can’t get much hope out of it. They hate us far more, altogether and all the time. If those two had seen us, they would have dropped all their quarrel until we were dead.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Return of the King&lt;/em&gt;, ‘The Land of Shadow’)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As is often the case with Tolkien a glance at &lt;em&gt;Beowulf&lt;/em&gt; can prove interesting. For in line 1105 we encounter a word that suits the orcs and Frodo’s description of them perfectly.  It is &lt;em&gt;morþorhete&lt;/em&gt;, a compound of &lt;em&gt;morþor&lt;/em&gt;, whose primary meaning is ‘murder’ and from which of course derives ‘Mordor’, and &lt;em&gt;hete&lt;/em&gt;, ‘hate.’ &lt;em&gt;Morþorhete&lt;/em&gt;, occurring only here in extant Old English, denotes a murderous or deadly hatred. Keep in mind, moreover, that every time we see orcs interacting with each other, whether they are of different kinds, as here, of different loyalties (&lt;em&gt;Two Towers&lt;/em&gt;, ‘The Uruk-hai’), or of different commands (&lt;em&gt;Two Towers&lt;/em&gt;, ‘The Choices of Master Samwise’; &lt;em&gt;Return of the King&lt;/em&gt;, ‘The Tower of Cirith Ungol’), they always come to blows. So the word is generally applicable to orcs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Beowulf&lt;/em&gt; the word appears in the account of the oath that was meant to restore peace after the attack on Finnsburgh:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Ða hie getruwedon    on twa healfa                        1095
fæste frioðuwære.    Fin Hengeste       &lt;br /&gt;
elne unflitme    aðum benemde
þæt he þa wealafe    weotena dome
arum heolde,    þæt ðær ænig mon
wordum ne worcum    wære ne bræce,                   1100
(ne) þurh inwitsearo    æfre gemænden,
ðeah hie hira beaggyfan    banan folgedon,
ðeodenlease,    þa him swa geþearfod wæs.
Gyf þonne Frysna hwylc    frecnen spræce
ðæs morþorhetes    myndgiend wære,                    1105
þonne hit sweordes ecg    syððan scede.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Then they concluded strong terms
Of peace for both sides. Finn declared
On oath to Hengest, nobly, with no dispute,
That he, by the authority of his council,
And with acts of kindness, would rule
The sad remnant, that neither by word
Nor by deed would any man break the accord,
Nor through malice would they ever complain –
Though, kingless now, they followed the killer
Of their generous lord: it had been
Necessary for them. Then if any of the Frisians
With reckless speech called to mind
Their murderous hate, a sword would settle it.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The connection here is not to be found in the details of the story of Finn and Hengest, but in the &lt;em&gt;morþorhete&lt;/em&gt; that remains alive just below the surface, so ready to break forth that only the threat of violence can suppress it even temporarily.  In the end the terms do not prove strong enough, any more for Finn and Hengest than for the orcs Frodo and Sam see in Mordor.  A passion so strong can unite or divide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; The translation offered above is mine, based on the text and notes in Klaeber’s &lt;em&gt;Beowulf&lt;/em&gt; (Toronto, 2014). It may not be elegant, but I believe that it is at least not inaccurate. There are, however, points in the Old English that are not entirely clear, but these do not touch the issue of &lt;em&gt;morþorhete&lt;/em&gt; directly.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This week Rounded Globe released Bryn Hammond’s essay on her discipline of historical fiction. Today fellow author John Caviglia discusses Hammond’s historical fiction itself.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amgalant One: The Old Ideal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amgalant Two: Tribal Wars&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, by Bryn Hammond&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These two extraordinary works launch a novelized exegesis of &lt;em&gt;The Sacred History of the Mongols&lt;/em&gt;—which recounts the life of Genghis Khan, penned sometime after his death in 1227.  Hammond’s initial volumes expand this slender inspiration (fewer than 200 pages in one English edition) to genuinely epic proportions, creating a rich, compulsively readable, immersive work.  And as the two novels—totaling about 1300 pages—begin a trilogy, a reader might ask why, and how, Hammond has so amplified the original…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As to the why, it is clear that—Medievalist to the marrow—she is herself enraptured by the Mongols of the time, above all by the fascinating characters in this history of conquest without parallel, rendered “secret” by time and culture, language and abbreviation.  Implicit, in the cryptic text she studies, are secrets of the soul embedded in the acts and words, the entwined intricacies of these Mongols’ lives, a tribal psychology she unfolds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hammond has exhaustively studied every aspect of her enterprise, and it is upon that ocean of research that her prose effortlessly floats, ensuring that the reader will travel in space and time to the cultural moment.  And in that richly elaborated context the Temujin of her text—one day to be known as Genghis Khan—is fashioned into what was prophesied when he was born with a blood clot in his fist. You learn what the Mongols eat (a lot of sheep) and drink (black milk!).  You encounter much more about day-to-day tribal life.  But, essentially, the novel takes you into the minds of the protagonists…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reader comes to see Mongols as Mongols saw each other … and the larger world (I got a new take on ancient China, and that wall intended to keep “barbarians” out).  And that kind of vision is where much of the action takes place in this essentially psychological work.  Interior conflicts….  Interior/exterior conflicts…. Interior monologues….  Interior dialogues….  Plain old dialogues….    And then there are the tribal conferences.  Alliance with the Tartars?  War?  Questions are at the heart of this version of the Mongol enterprise, when the future of much of the world hinged on a shaman’s reading the cracks in a sheep’s scapula.  The rise of Genghis Khan was prophesied indeed, but Hammond portrays it as a chancy, supremely complicated and unfolding thing, lived out in the minds of those who—on horseback and in tents—crafted the largest empire known to man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the fate of Tchingis Khan continues its extraordinary course in &lt;em&gt;Tribal Wars&lt;/em&gt;, the tale expected of a conqueror—his unification of the Mongols (thus the enormous sweep of the steppes) by dint of martial talent, native wit and bloodshed—is well and intricately told.  But less expectedly the story of Temujin, conqueror as human being, is brought to the fore.  In particular his tortured relationship to his blood brother, lover and erstwhile enemy, Jamuqa, is here deepened, developed, and brought to an ending dramatic, and deeply tragic, as any that I know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not unfair, I think, to state that Hammond’s writing is intimately epic—immense in the necessity of its scope, intimate in the attention devoted to relationships: Tchingis/Temujin and Jamuqa, Tchingis and Borte (first wife and queen), he and his various generals and subordinates, he and his many allies and antagonists….  This, as opposed to the lovingly lingering descriptions of combat stemming from classic epics such as &lt;em&gt;The Iliad&lt;/em&gt;, which culminate in modern historical novels depicting medieval war, such as Bernard Cornwell’s.  In &lt;em&gt;Tribal Brawls&lt;/em&gt; a battle supremely important to Tchingis is depicted in two pages….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hammond’s portrayal of conquest echoes the intimacy of Elizabethan theater—principal characters on stage, the larger war in the wings revealed by alarums and the tidings of messengers.  Not having read &lt;em&gt;The Secret History of the Mongols&lt;/em&gt;, I do not know how much of such ‘staging’ she imports.  However, she has her own Tchingis say, “Wars are fought in the head, always.”  And it seems to me right to have the reader’s attention led to what is personal in this epic, for in the second volume civil war is eponymously depicted, the steppe fighting itself, so to speak (iconically condensed into the lover/enemy relationship of Tchingis and Jamuqa).  Such steppe people as Tchingis did not woo, he had to conquer to embrace.  Hammond’s Tchingis states: “The whole point of me is freedom for my people.”  Tough love, indeed….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for Hammond’s prose, it is wonderfully her own, rich with word play, sometimes lyrical, at times formal and hieratic, often chortle-out-loud funny, and always dense with resonance.  But there’s an aspect to her voice that at first surprised me.  Hammond is—could it be gleefully?—anachronistic, both in authorial comments and through her Medieval Mongols, who speak contemporary, sometimes slangy language (British at that … so that I had to look up “ta”).  If you are bothered by such anachronism, you will be bothered.  As for me—after brief adjustment—I thoroughly enjoyed the read, for Hammond’s writing, nuanced, never usual, is a good in itself.  And to me at least, her authorial anachronism suggests a Shakespeare play staged in a radically different time and place, so to convey—bass beat under melodies—that the drama is universally human at its core.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of surprises, one more thing—I love the strength, depth and wisdom of the women in Amgalant, given a society and a time in which they were a spoil of war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sum—as begun—this trilogy is unique and wonderful (though not necessarily easy). Hats off to Hammond for her long, loving and genial discipline.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>It&#39;s the Stupidity, Stupid</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Intellectual historian Keith Tribe offers a domestic perspective upon the current debate over Britexit from the EU.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been observing recent political events with a sense of deep-seated dismay.  In Britain, the first half of 2015 was dominated domestically by the backwash of the Scottish Independence referendum; internationally, by the circus of the Greek debt crisis, where Tsipras would agree one thing in Brussels and then go home and disown what he had agreed on TV, as if nobody outside Athens watched Greek TV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scottish independence vanished from the public agenda of the SNP within a few months of the referendum, with the collapse of the oil price.  Scotland’s prosperity now clearly lies with the current terms of the Union.  Although it should be noted that when in 2013 it looked as though the Grangemouth refinery was to be closed, the real problem was that this one closure would take 10% of the Scottish manufacturing base with it.  In January 2016 Scotland’s non-oil and gas exports to the rest of the United Kingdom were four times that to the rest of the EU and increasing – exports to the rest of the EU had fallen 8% in one year.  So the idea that the path to prosperity lay through an independent Scotland was always a rather flaky idea.  Besides which, actually establishing an independent Scotland could well turn out as costly as the Darien project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much the same is true of the idea that Britain could prosper through leaving the EU.  As Philip Stephens has pointed out in the FT recently, the idea that Britain could “reclaim sovereignty” by leaving the EU is self-refuting: the possibility of leaving is itself confirmation of sovereignty.  Quite apart from the very rudimentary idea of “sovereignty” that those who make such arguments display, detached from any serious consideration of the relationships now existing between European states, or any comprehension of the government of modern polities.  Best estimates of the economic gains from membership of the EU run at about 10%: that Britain is now 10% better off than it would have been had it never been a member of the EU.  Detaching Britain from the EU, and reorganising our political, economic and social relationships with the world’s third-most important political bloc, could well chew through that in short order.  What the dawning new era would be like is anyone’s guess, but there is no particular reason to suppose that it would be any improvement on the present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scottish independence could well follow on from Brexit.  The turbulence of Spanish politics could well lead into Catalan independence given the reduced legitimacy of established parties.  In France there is a related lack of support for the mainstream parties of right and left, which only together seem capable of stemming the electoral advance of the Front Nationale.  Similar stories of disaffected voters placing their faith in the politics of anti-politics can be told about Italy, Germany, Greece, The Netherlands, and Denmark.  And on the other side of the Atlantic those with any commitment to serious politics look on aghast as a huckster channelling the ghost of Huey Long steadily treads his path to nomination as the Republican Party presidential nominee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Max Weber noted, modern politics requires the firm, slow boring of hard boards, united with passion and a sense of proportion.  Today many seem to think that passion is enough.  “People” are said to be disaffected from politics and political leadership; a new antipolitics is said to be abroad.  True enough, today some of the leading British parliamentary figures plumb new depths of shallowness.  David Cameron presents himself as the honest broker seeking to save us from a mess he created in the first place by his casual approach to party politics. Tariq Ali tells us in the last &lt;em&gt;London Review of Books&lt;/em&gt; that Jeremy Corbyn articulates a national mood – clearly he does not get out much, nor has he noticed that it is Corbyn’s advisers who seem to do all the articulating, the Labour Party leader being mostly mute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The practice of politics in a representative democracy is an unedifying sight.  Representative democracy is however what we have, and the alternatives – plebiscitary democracy, authoritarian democracy, monarchy, dictatorship, oligarchic rule – are all much worse.  We should be grateful for what we have, not be surprised by how imperfect it is.  Our efforts should be directed to improving ourselves and those around us, not blaming remote others for not giving us what we want.  All of the countries and regions mentioned above belong to the wealthiest part of the modern world.  Even being poor in a wealthy country is very rarely much like being even reasonably well-off in a poor country, a point that Adam Smith made long ago.  Articulating this principle in discussion of Europe’s immigration crisis would be helpful.  Simply being alive is a privilege; being alive in a wealthy country confers enormous benefits on those who live there, benefits to which they themselves have directly contributed little.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no economic case for Brexit, but that is more or less beside the point.  Extending the line of argument above, being a citizen of an EU member state brings with it social and cultural advantages that, being taken for granted, are usually ignored.  Britain is now more like e.g. Holland than it is like any other non-EU country in the world – not the same, but in many significant ways similar.  Only for tourists and a wealthy elite does the USA look anything like Britain.  The truth of this is confirmed by the progress of Donald Trump through the Republican primaries.  But even here we can find confirmation of Adam Smith’s analysis of commercial society: that its motor is emulation and vanity; translated into the political process, those who already have much of what they need respond to politicians who promise them more of what they already have, which they no longer even notice they have.&lt;/p&gt;

   <link href="http://roundedglobe.github.io/unix/"/>
   <updated>2016-03-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://roundedglobe.github.io/unix</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Unix is an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system&quot;&gt;operating system&lt;/a&gt; (OS) invented in 1969 at Bell Labs by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson&quot;&gt;Ken Thompson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie&quot;&gt;Dennis Ritchie&lt;/a&gt; and others. And — due to the flexibility afforded by its modular, collaborative approach to computing — over 40 years later, Unix and its descendants &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_operating_systems#Market_share_by_category&quot;&gt;power the overwhelming majority of the world’s computing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The family of operating systems which descend from Unix are referred to collectively as “*nix”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sites like Google, Facebook, Twitter and the vast majority of websites were built on and run on *nix. Apple’s iPhones, iPads and iPods, Android smartphones and tablets, smart TVs, refrigerators, cameras, cars, watches, set-top boxes — they all run *nix. Unix and its offspring power everything from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi&quot;&gt;Raspberry Pi&lt;/a&gt; to (all of) the world’s most powerful supercomputers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The digital age was built on Unix and its descendants. So how did this happen?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the early days of computing, software was shared freely amongst its users and authors, who were often the same people. If you wrote a software tool to perform a particular task you would share it with anyone who wanted it. If I improved that tool then I would share my changes with you and with everyone else. This benefited everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This culture of sharing and co-operating influenced the shape of early software, encouraging the production of small, simple programs intended to be used together to perform complex tasks — rather than complex, monolithic programs that tried to do everything. Smaller, simpler programs were easier to maintain, share, re-use and modify, and could be plugged together to perform complex tasks. Improvements to one small component benefited &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the complex applications of which that small program was a part — helping oneself helped others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bell Labs is a research and development facility which, during the time of Unix’s development, was owned by AT&amp;amp;T and was famous for encouraging undirected, open-ended research. Important inventions and developments that came out of Bell Labs include the transistor, cellular telephony, solar cells, practical lasers, communication satellites, the touch-tone telephone and, of course, Unix. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Kernighan&quot;&gt;Brian Kernighan&lt;/a&gt;, one of the developers of Unix, talks about his time at Bell Labs in the video below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ytvid&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe class=&quot;video&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/QFK6RG47bww&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unix, born out of this culture of sharing and co-operation where a collaborative approach was &lt;em&gt;assumed&lt;/em&gt;, embodied what is now referred to as ‘The Unix Philosophy’. The most well-known statement of this philosophy, by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_McIlroy&quot;&gt;Doug McIlroy&lt;/a&gt;, goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Write programs that do one thing and do it well. Write programs to work together. Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;McIlroy adds:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The notion of “intricate and beautiful complexities” is almost an oxymoron. Unix programmers vie with each other for “simple and beautiful” honours — a point that’s implicit in these rules, but is well worth making overt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This insistence on simple elegance, modularity, co-operation and text-as-the-universal-interface is a large part of what set Unix apart and is, along with various technical attributes, what has been passed on to Unix’s descendants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unix gained widespread use through the 70s and 80s, particularly in academic and commercial settings but was not really suitable for individual use for a couple of reasons. Firstly, Unix was designed primarily for mainframes and there was little interest amongst its academic and commercial users in transferring it to home computers. Secondly, as a regulated monopoly AT&amp;amp;T were not allowed to sell software, so licensing was difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the personal computer saw broad adoption, the rise of proprietary, commercial software, such as Microsoft’s DOS, eroded the culture of early computing — sharing proprietary software is illegal and modifying it is impossible since the source code is not available. As programs could no longer share and build upon each others’ functionality, software became large, complex and monolithic by default.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1983, &lt;a href=&quot;https://rms.sexy/&quot;&gt;Richard Stallman&lt;/a&gt;, an artificial intelligence researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, began the GNU project, the aim of which was to create an entirely free version of the Unix operating system (GNU stands for “GNU’s not Unix”). “Free”, in this context, means “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html&quot;&gt;free as in freedom, not free as in beer&lt;/a&gt;”, a notion circumscribed by what Stallman called ‘the Four Freedoms’:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor (freedom 2).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to ensure that these freedoms remained intact as software was modified and shared, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html&quot;&gt;GNU General Public License&lt;/a&gt; (GPL) was created. Similar to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/&quot;&gt;Creative Commons&lt;/a&gt; license used on &lt;em&gt;Rounded Globe&lt;/em&gt;, the GPL employs a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft&quot;&gt;copyleft&lt;/a&gt; mechanism that ensures that no one can close the software down and/or make a proprietary version — the software will be free for everyone, forever, for any purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1991, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds&quot;&gt;Linus Torvalds&lt;/a&gt;, a computer science student at the University of Helsinki, created the Linux kernel because he wanted Unix on his personal home computer. The kernel is the ‘bottom layer’ of the operating system; it is the intermediary between other software and the hardware — the final core component that the GNU project lacked. The resulting operating system — a complete, free Unix — is called GNU/Linux, though it is most often just referred to as Linux.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linux exists today as a free universal operating system that embodies the continuation of the culture of early computing — it is produced, maintained and distributed by thousands of people all around the world. It powers the internet and has allowed companies like Google, Twitter and Facebook to create businesses without being crippled by software licensing costs (there are none). It runs smartphones, laptops, tablets, Kindles and watches. It’s allowed the Raspberry Pi to bring accessible, malleable computing to classrooms and individuals without licensing costs. It runs the computers at &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERN&quot;&gt;CERN&lt;/a&gt;, it’s on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curiosity_%28rover%29&quot;&gt;Curiosity Mars rover&lt;/a&gt;, it’s aboard the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station&quot;&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt; and it runs &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-munich-rejected-steve-ballmer-and-kicked-microsoft-out-of-the-city/&quot;&gt;Munich&lt;/a&gt;. Unless you live in a cave, you use Linux many times every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Linux’s most surprising achievement, though, is getting huge, commercial entities like Google, Samsung, IBM, Toyota and countless others to work collaboratively. They all contribute — through paying developers, sponsorship and other mechanisms — to the Linux kernel and other parts of the operating system. And when they improve Linux for themselves they improve it for everyone else — even their direct competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one arena of computing where *nix &lt;em&gt;doesn’t&lt;/em&gt; dominate is desktop operating systems (i.e. desktop PCs and laptops), where Microsoft’s Windows holds sway. So, while Unix and its progeny have very much defined and shaped the technology of the world in which we live, and virtually &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; computer user interacts with it in some way on a daily basis, most everyday computer users are largely unaware of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to try Linux out on &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; desktop or laptop computer then &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop&quot;&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.opensuse.org/&quot;&gt;OpenSUSE&lt;/a&gt; are good places to start.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Agricultural Strategy</title>
   <link href="http://roundedglobe.github.io/agricultural-strategy/"/>
   <updated>2016-02-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://roundedglobe.github.io/agricultural-strategy</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The second of a series of posts by Dr Mark McKerracher on the origins of agriculture.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Question: when is an agricultural strategy not an agricultural strategy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Answer: when it’s a socio-cultural strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, bear with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cast your mind back to my earlier post about &lt;a href=&quot;http://roundedglobe.github.io/origins-of-british-agriculture/&quot;&gt;Neolithic farming in Britain&lt;/a&gt;.  As you may recall, archaeobotanists Stevens &amp;amp; Fuller (2012) have argued that crop husbandry had something of an abortive start in Britain: fading out around the Middle Neolithic and only returning with a “major upsurge in agricultural activity” in the Middle Bronze Age, from around 1500 BC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said at the time, I’m not a prehistorian, so I’m in no position to critique the model. But I was interested to discover, after writing the earlier post, an article from 2000 which puts a different perspective on things (Brück 2000).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since this work came twelve years before Stevens &amp;amp; Fuller’s botanical study, it’s obviously not a rebuttal – nor vice versa, since S&amp;amp;F don’t cite Brück. What it does, however, is suggest a model to explain why things seem to have changed in the Middle Bronze Age. It also provides a corrective to the overtly economic interpretations that have often been placed on the process. Since this period sees the appearance of clearly-defined “farmstead” settlements for the first time, some scholars have suggested that agricultural activity must have intensified in this period – hence also the rise in crops identified by S&amp;amp;F. This all sounds pretty reasonable – unless you think, like Brück, that those Bronze Age folk weren’t actually interested in maximizing productivity. Rather, she suggests that their main reason for creating (relatively) stable farmsteads within spatially defined farming units was a new pattern of social thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll offer a crude oversimplification of Brück’s argument, for laymen like myself, with apologies to specialists for the inaccuracies and misunderstandings. Here goes. In the Neolithic and Early Bronze Age, we’ve got societies without fixed settlements, but with larger-scale, periodic gatherings of extended kin-groups at monumental sites – henges and the like. But from the Middle Bronze Age, you have these relatively stable settlements, as family groups preferred to stress their autonomy – real or ideal – rather than their fluid connections within the wider kin group. In short, as communities came to be defined by a new social order, the farmsteads represent the imposition of a new physical, spatial order. So the new approaches to farming were the &lt;em&gt;result&lt;/em&gt; – rather than the cause – of social change. Of course, we then have to wonder: what caused the social change in the first place? And there’s no easy answer to that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t do justice to the hypothesis here. It draws upon waggon-loads of archaeological and anthropological theory (“ontological security”…? ) but it’s compelling, nonetheless. I never realized, before reading this, that I’d often made an implicit assumption that maximising agricultural production is a desirable thing to do. And to an extent, I still think that’s a reasonable assumption. You surely don’t have to be an arch-capitalist to think that a bit more surplus grain might come in useful. But clearly social circumstances will count for a lot. It’s a matter of perspective, and since we’ll never know what the Bronze Age perspective really was, the speculation will no doubt continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MJM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Late Antique climate change was in the news last week!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evidence being put together by Ulf Büntgen and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pages-igbp.org/ini/wg/euro-med2k/erl-faqs-january-2016&quot;&gt;Euro-Med2k Working Group&lt;/a&gt; about Europe’s changing climate is creating a fantastic resource for understanding better the relationship between climate and the course of history. Some of their conclusions are terrifying, particularly that present average summer temperatures have no parallels over the past 2000 years. Let’s not deny climate change is a real thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet. There is, as my friend &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ed.ac.uk/history-classics-archaeology/about-us/staff-profiles/profile_tab1_academic.php?uun=mazzolin&quot;&gt;Monica Azzolini&lt;/a&gt; put it last week, a need for a ‘more nuanced environmental history that actually uses both micro-historical tools and macro-historical tools together’. The reporting of what is now being called ‘The Late Antique Little Ice Age’ makes this a real case in point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea that there was some environmental change in the period is not new. There have been discussions for years about evidence for a major volcanic eruption around AD536 – an eruption Büntgen now reckons was actually three in relatively quick succession and which forced a drop of maybe up to 4°C in some areas. &lt;a href=&quot;http://isites.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=k40117&amp;amp;pageid=icb.page188194&quot;&gt;Michael McCormick&lt;/a&gt; has already published articles arguing that environmental instability helped to destabilise the Roman Empire and to provide conditions for the Justinian Pandemic (i.e. plague) of the sixth century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, onto the new reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First up, I saw &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.archaeology.wiki/blog/2016/02/09/new-little-ice-age-coincides-fall-eastern-roman-empire-growth-arab-empire/&quot;&gt;‘New “Little Ice Age” coincides with fall of Eastern Roman Empire and growth of Arab Empire’&lt;/a&gt;. In this article, Büntgen is quoted as saying ‘with so many variables, we must remain cautious about environmental cause and political effect, but it is striking how closely this climate change aligns with major upheavals across several regions’. (I like ‘We must remain cautious… but…’ there – a classic academic sidestep). The big story should now apparently be: sixth-century tribes moved from the steppes of northern China, formed an alliance with the East Romans, and helped to defeat the Sasanian Empire in Persia in the early seventh century, paving the way for the rise of the Arab Empire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What has been ‘explained’ here? As put in the article, the movement of the steppe peoples, prompted by climate change, explains everything that happens thereafter. But it doesn’t. The course of the reign of Herakleios (r.610-641), which covers the defeat of the Persians and the first major successes of the Arabs, was highly complex on almost every conceivable level. Here is the briefest &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.roman-emperors.org/heraclis.htm&quot;&gt;summary&lt;/a&gt;. Climate change may explain some aspects of some factors in play, but it does not explain ‘what happened’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there was this story in &lt;em&gt;New Scientist&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newscientist.com/article/2076713-125-year-mini-ice-age-linked-to-the-plague-and-fall-of-empires/?platform=hootsuite&quot;&gt;‘125-year mini ice age linked to plague and fall of empires’&lt;/a&gt;. Again these links are a bit vague. ‘There was dramatic social, cultural, and political change in this period. Perhaps aspects of the changes were exacerbated by a colder period’, suggests Late Romanist/Byzantinist Shaun Tougher. Francis Ludlow adds, ‘ultimately there can be very little doubt that these sorts of abrupt climate events place great stress on societies, and can sometimes tip them over the edge’. Both of these statements are entirely reasonable. Neither of them actually addresses whether the changes in the environment had any actual role to play in the shaping of the events the article is about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article finishes with some comments about ‘weather winners’, as some people may have benefited from climate change. Good. Büntgen returns here, suggesting that the Arab conquests of the seventh century may have been helped by increased vegetation caused by climate change. Fine. And Büntgen does not seem to be suggesting that this was ‘the cause of the Arab conquests’. But without any context, it is awkward. There is no suggestion that the Arabs were taking advantage of an East Rome weakened by its recent struggles against the Persian Empire, no suggestion that the leaders were energised by the teaching of Muhammad (d. 632) – there were a lot of political and cultural factors in play, and explaining the Arab conquests on the basis of feeding camels alone is &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; why invoking environmental factors remains controversial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does not need to be a competition, environment vs people. Let’s be honest: ‘it was a combination of factors’. Changing climate can trigger important changes. People, being people, respond to these changes in different ways. Tying climactic patterns to large-scale ‘rise and fall’ patterns isn’t necessarily helpful, if it promotes a clunky monocausalism. Sometimes people do things, achieve things, despite what the weather is doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was why I was already undertaking my mini &lt;a href=&quot;https://merovingianworld.wordpress.com/2015/10/16/climates-of-crisis/&quot;&gt;‘Climates of Crisis’&lt;/a&gt; project. We need to understand better the ways in which environmental crisis becomes a human crisis. We need to understand how climate changes intersects with political, religious, and cultural thinking. The work of Büntgen and his colleagues is fantastic – and more historians need to bring their tricks to the party.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Changing Faces of Britain&#39;s Natives</title>
   <link href="http://roundedglobe.github.io/changing-faces-of-britain's-natives/"/>
   <updated>2016-02-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Simon J. Cook, Rounded Globe author, shares some of his research into the history of British conceptions of prehistory and the genesis of Tolkien’s hobbits.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Late-Victorian histories of the English began in the woods of Schleswig, before the migration to the British Isles. But around 1900 historians decided that English history proper should begin with the foundation of the modern state in the fourteenth century. What came before was deemed not only barbarous but insufficiently documented. The story of ancient Britain, and of the peoples who settled it, was left to a motley crew of archaeologists, folklorists, philologists and, increasingly, writers of fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;illustration&quot;&gt;


&lt;a href=&quot;/images/Cook1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Cook1.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first section of my Rounded Globe essay on &lt;a href=&quot;http://roundedglobe.com/book/54f6fe79648a590459746be1/J.R.R.%20Tolkien&#39;s%20Lost%20English%20Mythology&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;J.R.R. Tolkien’s Lost English Mythology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I’ve discussed some facets of the early twentieth-century search for the ancient English; in this post I track the changing face of Britain’s natives. The picture above depicts a sort of ancient ‘close encounters’ moment: native Britons watch the arrival of the Roman fleet of Julius Caesar. This captures the conventional Victorian image of the Romans bringing civilization to a savage island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compare the primitive Britons above, barefoot and attired in rude animal skins, with the blond giants below. Although this second picture was published earlier, it embodies a newer kind of historical thinking. These iron-age warriors are still Britons, but they are no longer natives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;illustration&quot;&gt;


&lt;a href=&quot;/images/Cook2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Cook2.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For much of the nineteenth century it was assumed that Britain had been settled for only a few generations before the coming of the Romans. But this view became untenable after 1877 and the publication of Canon William Greenwell’s &lt;em&gt;British Barrows&lt;/em&gt;. From his meticulous and extensive archaeological excavations, Greenwell drew the conclusion that prehistoric long barrows were not only older than round barrows, but had been built by a different people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;illustration&quot;&gt;


&lt;a href=&quot;/images/Cook3.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Cook3.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;span&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Image from: &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/details/britishbarrowsre00gree&quot;&gt;British Barrows. A record of the examination of the sepulchral mounds in various parts of England&lt;/a&gt;, by W. Greenwell (Oxford, 1877).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Greenwell it was generally accepted that the Celtic-speaking Britons, the supposed makers of the round barrows, had intruded upon an earlier population. The result was the rehabilitation of the Britons: no longer the passive victims of history, conquered and pushed aside by more vigorous peoples, the Britons became invading immigrants in their own right – ancient barbarians, maybe, yet virtuous and worthy ancestors for the modern British. In the caption of the second picture above the leading Briton declares: ‘Tell Suetonius that we scorn his mercy and will die as we have lived, free men.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who, then, were the newly discovered natives? With precious little archaeological or philological evidence to work with, scholars turned to fairy tales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1900 John Rhys, the first Oxford Professor of Celtic, delivered the presidential address to the Anthropology section of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/details/reportofbritisha00scie&quot;&gt;British Association for the Advancement of Science&lt;/a&gt;. His chosen theme was the value of folk tales for the study of the ancient past, and he argued that behind the ‘rabble of divinities and demons’ who disport themselves in Celtic folklore it is possible to discern the succession of peoples who have inhabited the British Isles. Welsh fairy stories, according to Rhys, contained dim memories of the native population encountered by the first Celtic-speaking intruders. The real ‘little people’, he inferred, had been ‘a small swarthy population of mound-dwellers, of an unwarlike disposition… and living underground’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;illustration&quot;&gt;


&lt;a href=&quot;/images/Cook4.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Cook4.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;span&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Picture from the cover of &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/details/watcherbythresho00buchuoft&quot;&gt;John Buchan’s The Watcher by the Threshold&lt;/a&gt; (London, 1902).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rhys’ ideas seem to have sparked the imagination of a couple of young minds. John Buchan went up to Oxford in 1895. His short story ‘No-Man’s-Land’, which appeared in print seven years later, tells the dreadful story of an Oxford scholar of Northern Antiquities (like Rhys perhaps, or one of his students), who holidays in the remote Highlands of Scotland, where he encounters – and is  taken captive by – ‘the Hidden People’:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Then suddenly in the hollow trough of mist before me… there appeared a figure. It was little and squat and dark; naked, apparently, but so rough with hair that it wore the appearance of a skin-covering… in its face and eyes there seemed to lurk an elder world of mystery and barbarism, a troll-like life which was too horrible for words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While captive in their ‘hill refuge’ the Oxford scholar hears harsh words directed at the British invader, bitter curses for the Saxon stranger; and he glimpses ‘a morbid hideous existence’ preserved for centuries by these relics of a nameless past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buchan’s natives are the complete antithesis of the modern British subject; a sort of primitive Hyde to the modern Dr. Jekyll. One can perhaps discern a post-WWII twist to this fable in &lt;em&gt;The Inheritors&lt;/em&gt;, the 1955 novel by William Golding (who incidentally attended the same Oxford college as Buchan). In Golding’s story the original dwellers of the land have become Neanderthals – a separate species to modern humans. But in contrast to Buchan, Golding represents these natives as a peaceful if queer-thinking folk; it is the human intruders who are violent and frightening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buchan’s portrayal of Britain’s ancient folk as radically different to the modern population of the British Isles made for a good story; but it did not reflect an Edwardian scholarly consensus that &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; newcomers to Britain had interbred with those already settled on the land. Far from being a separate species, scholars believed that much native blood flows through the veins of the inhabitants of modern Britain (the same kind of idea is now put in terms of DNA). An Englishman, a Scotsman, or a Welshmen who meets one of the forgotten little people is quite possibly discovering but a smaller version of himself. And if such encounters have today become rather rare in the fields and hedgerows of Britain, this is a familiar enough experience to many readers of J.R.R. Tolkien’s classic children’s story of 1937, &lt;em&gt;The Hobbit&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hobbits are a homely depiction of Britain’s natives. Tolkien tells us that they are a ‘little people’, who today ‘have become rare and shy of the Big People, as they call us’. But once upon a time, ‘long ago in the quiet of the world, when there was less noise and more green’, hobbits were ‘numerous and prosperous’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going up to Oxford in 1911, Tolkien as an undergraduate probably attended Rhys’ lectures; later, in a short essay of 1932, we find him engaging carefully with his scholarship. And it seems that Tolkien had read the Professor of Celtic’s 1900 presidential address. At one point in this lecture Rhys discusses certain ‘underground – or partially underground – habitations’ that, he believed, had been home to Britain’s natives. These abodes, he explains:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;appear from the outside like hillocks covered with grass, so as presumably not to attract attention… But one of the most remarkable things about them is the fact that the cells or apartments into which they are divided are frequently so small that their inmates must have been of very short stature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if Tolkien first stumbled upon a hobbit hole whilst reading Rhys’ lecture, it seems likely that his imagination drew also upon Buchan’s depiction of Britain’s natives as subhuman trolls. Certainly, John Buchan was one of Tolkien’s favourite authors. Of course, Bilbo’s hole under the hill is snug and comfortable; the encounter with a ‘hideous existence’ within a ‘hill refuge’ described by Buchan finds its counterpart, not at Bag End, but in that cave deep within the Misty Mountains into which had wormed his way, long ages ago, ‘a small slimy creature’ called Gollum.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Command Line</title>
   <link href="http://roundedglobe.github.io/the_command_line/"/>
   <updated>2016-02-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://roundedglobe.github.io/the_command_line</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Drew Holgate, co-founder of Rounded Globe, begins a series of occasional posts highlighting the significance of Linux, the free software movement, and other techy issues that the educated public should be aware of, but aren’t.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Don’t you have to use the command line?” or “Isn’t Linux a command line?” are concerns people often raise when thinking about switching to Linux.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they tend to be mollified with something like “No, you never need to touch the command line. You can do everything you’d do on any other computer without ever seeing the command line”. Which is perfectly true. But we see the unspoken question in their eyes; “If you don’t have to use it, then why on earth &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; you?”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They don’t actually ask it because they’re afraid we’ll talk more about Linux.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it’s understandable, to their eyes the command line looks archaic — it’s what people used in the 70s and we’ve got &lt;em&gt;graphics&lt;/em&gt; now — why would you use something so &lt;em&gt;crude&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;illustration&quot;&gt;


&lt;a href=&quot;/images/the_command_line.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/the_command_line.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;span&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Well it’s beautiful to &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you are using a computer you are communicating with it; you are telling it what you want it to do and it is telling you the results of what you asked. The Linux command line is a verbal language for communicating with your computer. Linux commands are words in a language, each embodying one idea. Like words in any language, they can be arranged into sentences of any length and complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose, for some reason, I wanted an ordered, uppercase list of all the most common words in this document I’m writing now. In English that would be “Produce a list of the thirty most common words in this document with a frequency count, order it by frequency and then alphabetically, convert the words to uppercase and then email me the list”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the language of the Linux command line that would be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;tr -d &quot;\&quot;,&quot; &amp;lt; the_command_line.md | tr -cs &quot;[:graph:]&quot; &quot;\n&quot; | tr &quot;[:lower:]&quot; &quot;[:upper:]&quot; | awk &#39;{h[$1]++}END{for (i in h){print i&quot; (&quot;h[i]&quot;)&quot;}}&#39;| sort -nr -t$&#39;(&#39; -k2 -k1d | cat -n | head -n 30 | mailx -s &quot;common words&quot; uo.is.ou@gmail.com
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second later, &lt;a href=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/XCWUT0w.png&quot;&gt;the email arrives&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with any verbal language, you need to learn it before you can use it. But, like any language, you start small; first learning syntax and then filling out vocabulary. And of course &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page&quot;&gt;there’s a command&lt;/a&gt; for finding out what each command means and how to use it — a combined dictionary and textbook of sorts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could save the above command, perhaps calling it ‘count2email’, and then it becomes a word I can use — I have coined a new word in the language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A graphical user interface only allows the user to perform the discrete set of tasks that the programmer has explicitly provided — an application can either do something (like emailing a list of all the commonly used words) or it can’t. The command line allows the user to tell the computer &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; what to do. It is precise, expressive and lends itself particularly well to complex or repetitive tasks. If I wanted my computer to, every third Tuesday, make a list of the most common words in the file I have written to most recently, overlay those words on a randomly chosen image of a kitten from the internet and then post that image to my website, I could do that. I don’t know why I’d want to, but I could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course there are certain tasks for which a graphical interface is better-suited. But for those where it’s not, using one is like trying to have a conversation with another human using only Pictionary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why some people use the command line. Not out of necessity, but out of choice.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Chaucer Goes to the Golden Horde</title>

   <updated>2016-01-29T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://roundedglobe.github.io/chaucer-goes-to-the-golden-horde</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Today we publish a post by the historical novelist Bryn Hammond, whose &lt;a href=&quot;http://roundedglobe.com/book/54f6f692a26359d553f3348e/Voices%20from%20the%20Twelfth-Century%20Steppe&quot;&gt;_Voices from the Twelfth-Century Steppe_&lt;/a&gt; is scheduled for publication by Rounded Globe on March 15, 2016.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;illustration smallimg left&quot;&gt;


&lt;a href=&quot;http://amgalant.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/800px-Diego-homem-black-sea-ancient-map-1559.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://amgalant.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/800px-Diego-homem-black-sea-ancient-map-1559.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chaucer set his &lt;em&gt;Squire’s Tale&lt;/em&gt; at ‘Sarray, in the land of Tartarye’ – that is, Saray, city of the Golden Horde Mongols, Jochi’s &lt;em&gt;ulus&lt;/em&gt;, above the Black and Caspian Seas. What did Chaucer know or care about a Tartar khan at Saray and his court?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Squire’s Tale&lt;/em&gt;, as a romance, has been despised in the past; people have said it’s unfinished either because Chaucer had too much discrimination to go on or because the other Canterbury pilgrims stopped the squire’s drivel. You can &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.librarius.com/cantales.htm&quot;&gt;read it yourself&lt;/a&gt; and judge. If you like medieval romances (adventure tales, with fantastic happenings, errant knights and wandering plots), there’s nothing wrong with it. It is unfinished, to the point that it’s only just begun. We are left with the khan’s daughter, gifted with a ‘quaint ring’ that lets her understand the talk of birds, having listened to the confession of a she-falcon, intent on self-harm, who has been seduced and left for a rival; the rest of the court are still asleep, after a grand feast whereat was given to the khan a flying horse of brass, that transports you anywhere when you tweak its ears. Nobody knows what happened next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;illustration smallimg right&quot;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It used to be dismissed as a mishmash of wild marvels ‘for those who like that sort of thing’. Who knew that the &lt;em&gt;Squire’s Tale&lt;/em&gt; had historical value? Carmel Jordan told the world in 1987 when she consulted archaeological work written in Russian, and saw that the Golden Horde was as spectacular as Chaucer describes (you can take &lt;a href=&quot;http://ibnbattuta.berkeley.edu/6goldenhorde.html&quot;&gt;a little trip&lt;/a&gt; with Ibn Battuta, to visit the khan in his gold-tiled tent in 1332-3). The setting, at least, wasn’t wild imagination; and furthermore, she suggests that every marvel had its real-life kick-off: the bronze horse, for instance, might have been put into Chaucer’s head by gift steeds that caused a stir at Mongol courts for their unusual size and general foreign glamour. The khans had a fascination with contrivances, too, that might inspire Chaucer’s magical ornamentation: the ingenious silver tree that dispensed drinks at Karakorum had its counterpart in Saray.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chaucer, unfortunately, never set foot in Saray himself or indeed the Golden Horde. How did he come to be informed? In the latter 13th and the 14th centuries, near the end of which the &lt;em&gt;Squire’s Tale&lt;/em&gt; was written, the khans of Saray and the Italian merchant republics operated in a symbiosis, for an unprecedented age of trade. Genoese, above Venetians, won the major part of the Black Sea trade, and moved with confidence in the Mongol world. Genoa also outstripped other Italian cities in trade relations with England. Chaucer took part in a delegation to Genoa for trade discussions in 1372-3; subsequently he was employed in Customs for the port of London. It is agreed he had ample opportunity, in diplomatic and commercial circles, to hear from Genoese their tales of Saray.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently Michael Murrin has written a great book on &lt;em&gt;Trade and Romance&lt;/em&gt;: how romance, first turned by Marco Polo’s travels, changed from a ‘Celtic fantastic’ to a ‘marvelous real’ – set in Asia, and driven not by the interests of aristocratic fighting men, although these remain the heroes of romance, but by the adventurous activities of merchants. He posits a dual audience for such romances as the Squire’s Tale, both upper class and those who live by commerce. It is the case that fighting men didn’t visit Saray: merchants did (not that these merchants weren’t up for a fight). Merchants went further, and saw things undreamt of by knights. The popular romances followed in their steps – but doing this, they lost status, and were trivialised, too, in the scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Grand Challenges for Archaeology</title>
   <link href="http://roundedglobe.github.io/grand-challenges-for-archaeology/"/>
   <updated>2016-01-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://roundedglobe.github.io/grand-challenges-for-archaeology</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Michael E. Smith’s post is part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dougsarchaeology.wordpress.com/2016/01/01/the-grand-challenges-for-archaeology-a-blogging-carnival/&quot;&gt;Grand challenges for archaeology blogging carnival&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do archaeology in order to learn about the past. This is a pretty broad purview. We learn about an amazing variety of past things from archaeology, from Richard III’s posture to the causes of the Maya collapse, from what the Natufians ate for breakfast to how the Plains peoples hunted bison. We work hard to recover treasure, garbage, dirt, tools, cathedrals and latrines, and we use them to make statements about what happened long ago. We ask all sorts of questions: Whodunnit? What the heck is that? Why is this particular coin sitting in that specific layer? What were they thinking?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do archaeology for many diverse purposes, from reconstructing the lives of ancient kings and queens to creating historical narratives, from helping communities reconstruct their past to complying with government regulations. In this essay I will discuss one of those purposes—creating reliable information about past human societies. This is the primary goal of the archaeology I do, and to my mind this is the most important contribution archaeology makes to human knowledge. Another way of saying this is to claim that archaeology is a social science (Smith et al. 2012). That is, we contribute to the stock of knowledge about human societies around the globe and into the past. Our special brand of knowledge is distinctive in several ways that most of us can rattle off easily. We have access to human societies not documented by any other discipline (e.g., Natufian society). We can study change over longer periods of time than can historians. And we learn about aspects of past societies that cannot be studied well by other fields (e.g., material culture).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade I have become involved in several transdisciplinary research projects. I have learned to interact with scholars in other disciplines (including geography, planning, sociology, political science, economics, and physics), and I have had to read widely in disciplines far outside my comfort zone of archaeology and anthropology. These experiences have made me simultaneously optimistic and pessimistic about the ability of archaeology to generate reliable information about past human societies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My optimism has several components. First, our findings really do stand out as unique and important in bringing to light societies not accessible in any other way. I take examples from comparative urbanism, one of my research foci. Archaeology now describes quite a few fascinating and unique past cities and urban traditions—huge dense Tripolyan settlements (urban or not? How did so many Neolithic people live together?); the low-density urbanism of Mesoamerica, Africa and Asia (how did these cities work in a jungle setting?); or Çatalhöyük. Second, archaeology really does produce unique and important data—even on “historical” societies. No other discipline can study past settlement patterns, and archaeology has an incredible record of data on settlement sizes in many past regions. Third, a growing number of scholars in other disciplines actually take archaeological findings seriously and want to engage with archaeologists to learn more and to use our data. I am still surprised at this situation. Prior to going interdisciplinary ten years ago, my colleagues in cultural anthropology rarely expressed any interest at all in archaeology or my research. Now I interact with scholars in different disciplines who think our data can contribute to their research agendas. Amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I am also depressingly pessimistic about whether archaeological data can really contribute to social science knowledge and research beyond a couple of small projects here and there. Another way of putting this is to say that I think it will be hard to respond adequately to the many “grand challenges” to archaeology identified by Kintigh et al. (2014a, 2014b) until this higher-order challenge is pursued (click &lt;a href=&quot;http://publishingarchaeology.blogspot.co.il/2014/01/the-grand-challenges-for-archaeology.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for my take on those earlier grand challenges). This is my grand challenge here—to make the effort to change many entrenched archaeological practices to allow us to create reliable knowledge about past societies. We do good fieldwork, and our methods are constantly improving. We have access to a growing suite of sophisticated analytical techniques. But the results of our fieldwork and analysis are not yet building a solid foundation of evidence and data about past societies. Why not?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;two major roadblocks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Our data are not available; and,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Our epistemology is inadequate, particularly in the areas of theory and argument.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;our-data-are-not-available&quot;&gt;(1) Our data are not available&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “gray literature” of unpublished and poorly available contract archaeology reports is a vast sink of archaeological data. Some of it is reported in formats that can be used by other scholars, and some is not. Some is posted online, much is not. There is more contract archaeology going on around the world than grant-funded academic research, yet most of the results contribute little or nothing to building a systematic foundation of knowledge about the past. This needs to change. There are far too many academic archaeological research projects that are never adequately published, leaving important artifacts moldering in a dusty lab or analyzed data locked up in individual idiosyncratic data formats. And even archaeological data from projects that are published can be difficult to access; we need datafiles—not printed tables of numbers—and more excavation photographs—not the few that made it into the report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is getting uncomfortably personal now. My current project will be published and the data archived on tDAR before too long (I hope!). But the primary data for my earlier projects are sitting in ring binders, negative holders, a bunch of Excel and Access databases, and my own head. Should I start another fieldwork project, or spend my time archiving old data? The former is more fun, but perhaps the latter is of greater value to the discipline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge here is to change the behavior of individuals (like me) and to promote institutional solutions that will make our data available. Even when data ARE available, they will often need cleaning and sorting and recoding if we are going to compare our data to social science data about the present (Smith 2010). Creating and using data archives is a big part of this challenge, and that is why &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tdar.org/about/&quot;&gt;archives like tDAR&lt;/a&gt; are so important. But a change in the culture of archaeology may also be required. When an economic historian publishes a study that uses quantitative data, the datafiles are regularly posted and made available for others to use and reanalyze. Could anyone reanalyze my data that way? Not yet. We don’t have a culture within archaeology that promotes the easy sharing of data. A change in these norms would be a big improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;our-epistemology-is-inadequate&quot;&gt;(2) Our epistemology is inadequate&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Archaeology is a science, in the standard social-science conception of science as having these traits:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Knowledge is responsive to evidence&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Claims are exposed to challenge&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Findings should be internally coherent&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Arguments should be judged on the basis of explanatory power, generality, simplicity, and replicability. For discussion of these traits, see: Gerring (2012) or Wylie (2000).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of my colleagues who view archaeology as a branch of the humanities, or who are hostile to science for reasons postmodern or other, please ignore the following discussion; it does not apply to you. But if one accepts the notion that archaeology does indeed (or can) conform to the model of science as outline above, then one has to be depressed about the current state of archaeological epistemology. Propositions are rarely tested, claims are too infrequently challenged, and formal arguments are rarely examined for adequacy. I explore this situation and provide suggestions for improving our arguments in Smith (2015). One result of our sloppy epistemology is that we have failed to create a solid body of empirical knowledge that can be improved, refined, and extended as research proceeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When postmodernism hit the social sciences in the 1980s, disciplines such as sociology and political science gave it a look, made a few changes, and got back to work. But in anthropology or archaeology, postmodernism settled in as a systemic infection and pushed empirical, scientific approaches to the margins. In the archaeology of complex societies, postmodernism is still festering (post-processualism, post-structuralism, post-humanism, etc.). The assumptions of postmodern approaches contradict the principles of science as listed above. Postmodern approaches are incapable of testing empirical propositions or carrying out rigorous comparative analysis. This is not just my peculiar view of the world; this is basic social science epistemology, discussed in a rather extensive literature rarely considered by archaeologists (6 and Bellamy 2012; Gerring 2012; Hedström 2005; Mjøset 2001; Tilly 1994, 2008).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although few archaeologists use the phrase “postmodern” these days, this anti-science perspective is rampant in the discipline. As noted by a noted postmodern geographer, scholars now prefer to use the term “post-structuralism” because it is a “safer sounding label” than postmodernism (Soja 2001:11863). A major goal of scholarship from this perspective is to deconstruct or problematize knowledge. That is, the idea is to break down established knowledge. In science, on the other hand, the goal is to build and extend reliable bodies of knowledge. In several blog posts—see &lt;a href=&quot;http://publishingarchaeology.blogspot.co.il/2012/01/rejected-by-science_27.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://publishingarchaeology.blogspot.co.il/2012/06/science-type-1-vs-science-type-2.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;—I have discussed two types of “science” in archaeology. Science type 1 is research with a scientific epistemology as discussed here. Science type 2 is work in an interpretivist or non-scientific framework that employs scientific techniques from other disciplines as part of the research process. Archaeologists pursing this model can sometimes fool scientific granting agencies by touting their use of archaeometry or “archaeological science,” while hiding the fact that their research is governed by a non-scientific epistemology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only research carried out with a scientific epistemology, making rigorous empirical arguments about data and about the past, serves to build a body of archaeological knowledge that is capable of generating reliable conclusions about past human societies (beyond descriptions of individual sites or finds). The prevalence of non-scientific epistemologies in archaeology (all the “post-“ approaches) makes it difficult to create this reliable knowledge. Yet for many of us, the goal of our work is to say something useful about past human societies. As in the case of the first roadblock—data availability—the promotion of a scientific epistemology will require a change in the culture of archaeology. If we want to contribute to a body of empirical evidence about human societies and their change over time, then we have our work cut out for us. If we fail to meet this “grand challenge,” then it is hard to see how we can meet all the other grand challenges identified by Kintigh et al. (2014a, 2014b) and by the other bloggers participating in this event.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Origins of British Agriculture</title>
   <link href="http://roundedglobe.github.io/origins-of-british-agriculture/"/>
   <updated>2016-01-22T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://roundedglobe.github.io/origins-of-british-agriculture</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The first of a series of posts by Dr Mark McKerracher on the origins of agriculture. Subsequent posts will be published in this blog from time to time…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A relative of mine asked me how agriculture came about in the first place. It’s a fair enough question. We’re all so familiar with the concept of farming, that it’s hardly obvious how our distant ancestors moved from hunting and gathering to tilling the hateful earth. Indeed, I don’t (yet) have an answer to my relative’s question, but I thought I should start putting one together. And to avoid anything so strenuous as making a plan, I’ve decided to write these “Origins” in the order that things come to my attention, rather than the order in which they happened… not least because the chronology of early farming might prove to be a little tricky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, what better place to start than Britain itself, home to this blogger, and subject to a recent article in that venerable warhorse &lt;em&gt;Antiquity&lt;/em&gt; (Stevens &amp;amp; Fuller 2012). This article begins by claiming to rewrite the early history of Britain – no small claim! And as a bonus (for me), it’s written by two archaeobotanists, so how could I resist reviewing it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the uninitiated, it’s worth stating at the outset that we’re talking here about the Neolithic – the ‘new’ stone age, between about 6,000 and 4,000 years ago, a period which is broadly characterized by the widespread adoption of both farming and, increasingly, sedentary settlements. So how did this major change occur, and how quickly? As Stevens &amp;amp; Fuller describe, previous scholarship can be roughly divided into ‘abrupt’ and ‘gradual’ models. In the former case, the Neolithic starts with an agricultural bang; in the latter, agriculture is gradually adopted more and more from the later Mesolithic, through the Neolithic, and into the Bronze Age (pp.707-8). So what happened in Britain? And how on earth can we find out?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stevens &amp;amp; Fuller’s favoured approach is thoroughly &lt;em&gt;archaeobotanical&lt;/em&gt;: that is, they study the remains of ancient plants – specifically, the charred remains of cultivated and wild food plants. Fortunately, organic remains such as these can often be radiocarbon-dated, and the authors have compiled an impressive database with hundreds of dated items from Mesolithic, Neolithic and Bronze Age excavations in Britain. Basically, they chart the occurrence of crops (especially cereals) over time, and compare it to that of wild food plants (especially hazelnuts, which survive in particular abundance).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this way, they find some intriguing patterns. Firstly, Britain’s first domesticated crops seem to appear pretty early in the Neolithic, soon after 4,000 BC, with a relatively rapid uptake across the British Isles. Secondly, however, the occurrence of crops – relative to wild food plants – apparently tails off around 3,300 BC. In other words, their database has few if any dated crop remains for the ‘Middle’ and ‘Late Neolithic’, while hazelnuts continue to occur throughout these periods. Cereals don’t make a comeback until the Middle Bronze Age (around 1,500 BC).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stevens &amp;amp; Fuller therefore conclude that cereal-farming, although introduced in the Early Neolithic, was then abandoned during the millennia that witnessed the construction of monuments including Stonehenge. Only in the Middle Bronze Age did cereal-farming really set in for good. The  abandonment coincides broadly with some other perceived archaeological patterns: population decline and monument construction (including Stonehenge). By way of explanation, the authors suggest that &lt;em&gt;climatic deterioration&lt;/em&gt;, causing a run of bad harvests, may have led to the abandonment of early cereal-cultivation. But palaeoclimatology can be a rather slippery subject so, as usual, I’ll tip-toe carefully around it…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not a prehistorian, so I don’t feel qualified to comment too specifically on this paper. But I did find it fascinating. A relatively simple methodology (collecting figures and tracing patterns) has shown intriguing, unexpected results. This aspect particularly appeals to me, because it’s not unlike my own research. Archaeobotany so often languishes in specialist appendices of site reports with little attention to its (potentially very great) significance, so it’s pleasing to see plant remains taking centre stage in this article. But as the authors stress in their conclusion, the result is a very broad picture – broad in terms of geography and chronology – and of course it’s possible that the overall patterns may change considerably as more data become available. Even so, perhaps my favourite conclusion is this one (p.720):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;…the paper demonstrates the limitations of using traditional period divisions and highlights the need to escape the tyranny of the ‘Neolithic’ label, and its assumption of unchanging village farmers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good point well made. I like period divisions as much as the next archaeologist – but we shouldn’t let them get the upper hand! Food for thought indeed…&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Can&#39;t Disrupt This</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;elsevier-and-the-252-billion-dollar-a-year-academic-publishing-business&quot;&gt;# Elsevier and the 25.2 Billion Dollar A Year Academic Publishing Business&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twenty years ago (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scribd.com/doc/292346391/Forbes-Elsevier-1995&quot;&gt;December 18, 1995&lt;/a&gt;), Forbes predicted academic publisher Elsevier’s relevancy and life in the digital age to be short lived. In an article entitled “The internet’s first victim,” journalist John Hayes highlights the technological imperative coming toward the academic publisher’s profit margin with the growing internet culture and said, “Cost-cutting librarians and computer-literate professors are bypassing academic journals — bad news for Elsevier.” After publication of the article, investors seemed to heed Hayes’s rationale for Elsevier’s impeding demise. Elsevier stock fell 7% in two days to $26 a share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the smoke settles twenty years later, one of the clear winners on this longitudinal timeline of innovation is the very firm that investors, journalists, and forecasters wrote off early as a casualty to digital evolution: Elsevier. Perhaps to the chagrin of many academics, the publisher has actually not been bruised nor battered. In fact, the publisher’s health is stronger than ever. As of 2015, the academic publishing market that Elsevier leads has an annual revenue of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stm-assoc.org/2015_02_20_STM_Report_2015.pdf&quot;&gt;$25.2 billion&lt;/a&gt;. According to its 2013 financials &lt;a href=&quot;http://poeticeconomics.blogspot.co.il/2014/03/elsevier-stm-publishing-profits-rise-to.html&quot;&gt;Elsevier&lt;/a&gt; had a higher percentage of profit than &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2013/10/28Apple-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-Results.html&quot;&gt;Apple, Inc.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Schmitt1.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brian Nosek, a professor at the University of Virginia and director of the Center for Open Science, says, “Academic publishing is the perfect business model to make a lot of money. You have the producer and consumer as the same person: the researcher. And the researcher has no idea how much anything costs.” Nosek finds this whole system is designed to maximize the amount of profit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I, as the researcher, produce the scholarship and I want it to have the biggest impact possible and so what I care about is the prestige of the journal and how many people read it. Once it is finally accepted, since it is so hard to get acceptances, I am so delighted that I will sign anything — send me a form and I will sign it. I have no idea I have signed over my copyright or what implications that has — nor do I care, because it has no impact on me. The reward is the publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nosek further explains why researchers are ever supportive by explaining the dedicated loyal customer base mantra, “What do you mean libraries are canceling subscriptions to this? I need this. Are you trying to undermine my research?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to a steadfast dedication by researchers, the academic publishing market, in its own right, is streamlined, aggressive, and significantly capitalistic. The publishing market is also more diverse than just the face of Elsevier. Johan Rooryck, a professor at Universiteit Leiden, says, “Although Elsevier is the publisher that everybody likes to hate, if you look at Taylor &amp;amp; Francis, Wiley, or Springer they all have the same kind of practices.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heather Morrison, a professor in the School of Information Studies at the University of Ottawa, unpacks the business model behind academic publisher Springer and says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you look at who owns Springer, these are private equity firms, and they have changed owners about five times in the last decade. Springer was owned by the investment group Candover and Cinven who describe themselves as ‘Europe’s largest buy-out firm.’ These are companies who buy companies to decrease the cost and increase the profits and sell them again in two years. This is to whom we scholars are voluntarily handing our work. Are you going to trust them? This is not the public library of science. This is not your average author voluntarily contributing to the commons. These are people who are in business to make the most profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should a consumer heed Morrison’s rationale and want to look deeper into academic publishers cost structure for themselves one is met with a unique situation: the pricing lists for journals do not exist. “It’s because they negotiate individually with each institution and they often have non-disclosure agreements with those institutions so they can’t bargain with knowing what others paid,” says Martin Eve, founder of the Open Library of the Humanities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to a general lack of pricing indexes, the conversation around the value of a publication is further complicated by long-term career worth. David Sundahl, a senior research fellow at the Clayton Christensen Institute for Disruptive Innovation, says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We actually understand how money passed through to artists who wrote music and authors who wrote books — but it is not clear how the value of a publication in a top tier journal will impact someone’s career. Unlike songs or books where the royalty structure is defined, writing a journal article is not clear and is dependent not on the people who consume the information but rather deans and tenure committees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Schmitt2.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;disruption-doable&quot;&gt;Disruption Doable?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is precisely the prior lack of a pricing and value barometer that leads to the complexities associated with disrupting the main players in academic publishing. “Adam Smith’s invisible hand works to lower prices and increase productivity but it can only do so when valuation or pricing is known and the same thing is true for disruption. If you don’t know how to value something, you actually don’t have tiers of a market,” says Sundahl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a disruptive force was to significantly change academic publishing it needs to happen in a market that is currently underserved or undesirable by the large-scale publisher. “Disruptive innovation is usually driven by a group who can’t afford to build something that is as big, fancy and sophisticated as the existing solution — they then have to find a market where either people don’t have anything available to them or they are satisfied with something less than perfect,” says Sundahl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should academic scholarship keep existing in a similar trajectory as in the past decades Sundahl finds incumbents (existing big publishers) almost always win when competition takes place along those sustaining strategy lines. “To revolutionize academic publication, a new system would need to be developed in a basement market which would eventually enable people to gain enough credibility doing this new solution. People would then begin to value this lower end, well done research, and that is when the world starts to change,” says Sundahl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prior is exactly what large entities like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation or perhaps even top tier research one (R1) universities can’t do. “They have to play the game the way the winners are already playing it. Incumbents almost always win under those conditions,” says Sundahl. And to further complicate matters, junior colleges and community colleges, which perhaps would represent fertile grounds to be served by a newer, “basement market” entrant, may be less likely to spearhead this new outlet themselves due increasing government constraints focused nearly exclusively on job placement and starting salaries in lieu of a research-based, theoretical curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;open-access-packs-a-punch&quot;&gt;Open Access Packs a Punch&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Driven by the lopsided power structure the move toward open access and the unrestricted access to academic information has been exponentially growing. Perhaps it is, itself, a “basement market” for leveling the academic publication environment and creating a market where respect and credibility can be fostered, grown and transitioned into the existing academic prestige, merit, and tenure conversations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The open access environment is one of the more fertile environments for people to be thinking: if we don’t like the old way, what should the new way look like,” says Heather Joseph, executive director at the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC). Joseph finds that the quantifiable numbers of open access journals speak for themselves and says, “You can look at the number of strictly open access journals if you look at the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ). When it started tracking open access journals there were a few dozen and now they list over 10,000 open access journals.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The push toward open access is not only growing in sheer numbers of journals but also in an increasingly confrontational strategy that academics leverage against large publishers. “At the moment, the Netherlands, the whole country, has said to Elsevier that we want all of our researchers to be able to publish open access in your journals at the same rates we would pay for a subscription last year and if you can’t do that we’re going to cancel every one of your journals, for all of our universities nationwide,” says Eve. “They have a few days left to resolve this, and it looks like they are going to cancel all the Elsevier journals.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rooryck found his recent very public decision to step down and move his Elsevier journal Linga to open access met with complete support from the other six editors and 31 editorial board members. “The process went very easily. We were all aware of the pricing and Elsevier’s practices and within a week everyone agreed to resign,” says Rooryck. Eve’s platform, the Open Library of Humanities, will now house the new open access iteration of Lingua, which will be called Glossa. Eve says, “Right away it is 50% cheaper to run it through us then when it was with Elsevier. So anybody subscribing to it already sees 50% more revenue.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rooryck finds the move toward broad open access a natural progression and says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The knowledge we produce as academics and scientists should be publicly available in the same way we have a company that delivers water to our faucets and electricity to our home. These are things we have a right to. Public knowledge and education is a human right and it should not come with a profit tag of 35%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it appears open access has the ability to simultaneously diffuse academic knowledge to a larger body of readers and cut costs significantly, many feel that the for profit academic publishers are still situated to continue into the near future. Joseph says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I think the play for most smart commercial publishers is to try to preserve the current environment for as long as they can: delay the policy changes, delay the culture changes and to be working on things like tools and services applying to aggregation of data, where they are then embedding themselves more deeply in the workflow of researchers and becoming essential to researchers in a different way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you are no longer essential to researchers in the, ‘you have to publish in my journal in order to get tenure and promotion’ what do they replace that with? I think the smart publishing companies like Elsevier, like Springer, who are very smart in that regard, have been thinking about where they can go to be playing a role of continuing to be seen as essential by the research community once they are no longer playing the role of providing assessment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;onward-and-upward&quot;&gt;Onward and Upward&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In the US Congress we have been finally making &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.sciencemag.org/policy/2015/07/senate-panel-approves-public-access-bill&quot;&gt;progress&lt;/a&gt; with the Fair Access to Science and Technology Research (FASTR) bill. It moved through the committee it was referred to in the Senate and is poised to move out of the Senate and potentially be considered by the House and hopefully pass. Ten years ago, I would have said we didn’t have a chance to do a stand-alone bill,” says Joseph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the recent congressional support Joseph refers to is one more verifying measure that the majority of articles will be moving toward an open and accessible framework. Many in the academic community hope that this government support signals the reprioritization of a research framework and the switching of the guard. And while the prior is extremely important, others in the academic community are hoping to grow “basement markets” from the ground up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Center for Open Science, which provides seed funds to startups in the academic scientific research space, is led by Nosek and focuses on aligning scientific values to scientific practices. “The open science framework is just a means at connecting all the research services that researchers use across the entire research life cycle,” says Nosek.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nosek is optimistic about the evolution of technology in open science and says, “There are a lot of startups going at different parts of the research life cycle. Whether it is publication and what a publication means, or looking at full articles and whether you can make articles convey information in smaller bite size pieces.” Nosek tells me that there are so many solutions happening in research right now and mentions it is hard to judge what the true solutions will look like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I sometimes think some of the ideas haven’t a chance, but what do I know? I could be completely wrong about it. And that is the whole point — do some experimentation and try out ideas. And the fact is there are a lot of people who see what the problems are and have a unique sense of a potential solution — it is a very lively time to try out different answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time will tell if open access will be the needed disruption to allow the academic environment to right itself or if a new market emerges from startup incubators like the Center for Open Science. Regardless of how the future vision is realized, most in the academic community hope that the new iteration of scholarly articles and publishing will do more good toward humankind than that of a hefty profit margin.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A View from Jerusalem</title>
   <link href="http://roundedglobe.github.io/a-view-from-Jerusalem/"/>
   <updated>2016-01-08T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://roundedglobe.github.io/a-view-from-Jerusalem</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Welcome to the Rounded Globe blog! Our first post is an abridged version of Prof. Guy Stroumsa’s closing remarks at a conference held in Jerusalem earlier this month (January 2016). A scholar of comparative religion, Professor Stroumsa discussed the duty of scholarly subsversion. Speaking from the heart of a conflict, Stroumsa calls on intellectuals to step beyond aseptic seminar rooms into the wider world around them: a call to which we at Rounded Globe are deeply sympathetic.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, a &lt;em&gt;révolutionnaire manqué&lt;/em&gt;, the comparative study of religions and their cohort of dreams of transformations, of patterns of mutations, both within societies and inside the self, has always represented a deeply subversive activity. I wish to offer here a midrashic reflection of sorts on subversion as an intellectual and moral duty: that of refusing to lie on the Procrustean beds prepared for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the last half-century, the Hebrew University has been a true home for me, one which I never really left. A &lt;em&gt;witz&lt;/em&gt; describes psychoanalysts as people whose analysis was not quite successful: they were not able to move ahead. &lt;em&gt;Mutatis mutandis&lt;/em&gt;, the same could be said about professors and their education. The very first day of my new life in Israel, in July 1966 (I was eighteen, as old as the country), was also that of my baptismal day as a student at the Hebrew University – more precisely, at its summer Ulpan: the early stages of my interminable struggle with Hebrew. Like other ambitious universities, the Hebrew University has always known that its first, absolute commitment was to the search for truth and to what it entails: critical thought, moral backbone, intellectual freedom. The intellectual audacity expected from universities is worthless without the civic courage to constantly question thought patterns and attitudes current in their own societies, to affirm, clearly and loudly, their autonomy and independence from the bodies and governments funding them. In Rabelais’ lapidary dictum: “Science sans conscience n’est que ruine de l’âme.” This permanent questioning is, precisely, their duty of subversion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, paradoxically, universities are everywhere under threat, asked to ‘be relevant,’ rather than to search for truth, to ‘deliver’ rather than to educate. I say paradoxically, as human societies, despite blatant, shocking inequalities, have never been as affluent as they are today. I cannot analyze this paradox here or even attempt to suggest solutions. I want at least to stress what you all know, that Faculties of Humanities are much more seriously threatened that those of Sciences and vocational schools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The natural sciences have an easier time, I think, in their rebuttal of utilitarian demands, as it is relatively simple for them to show the value of pure research: no applied mathematics or physics without pure mathematics and physics. At least in theory, one can still make an argument about &lt;em&gt;la science pour la science&lt;/em&gt;, as one does about &lt;em&gt;l’art pour l’art&lt;/em&gt;. A similar argument is far less obvious for the humanities. Very soon, one will hear the argument about what the Germans call the &lt;em&gt;kleine Fächer&lt;/em&gt;, the “small fields,” such as, at least in the Israeli context, the paradigmatic Assyriology: too expensive, too few students. And besides, who cares about Assyriology?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem, I fear, is made more complex by the fact that the humanities, the &lt;em&gt;Geisteswissenschaften&lt;/em&gt;, in their wish to be taken seriously, have calqued themselves on the &lt;em&gt;Naturwissenschaften&lt;/em&gt;. They are still doing that, as shown by the latest fad, “digital humanities,” and by the widely spread tendency to value only what can be quantified. I am all for the use of modern technologies in the service of the humanities, but at the moment, the technologies seem to take over the fields rather than serve them. Faculties of Humanities risk forgetting that their task, beyond producing new knowledge, also consists in offering a reflection on knowledge, on its conditions, its limits and its meaning. Such a second-order reflection is essentially subversive, as it questions the natural acceptance of existing conditions for the reproduction of knowledge in society, including in its educational institutions, and in the political system sustaining them. The humanities are deeply unsettling, and therefore, in this age of increasing resistance to questioning, increasingly unfashionable. By historicizing and relativizing all ideas and world-views, they disturb what is held sacred in all quarters. It is, then, by nature that the humanities, more than any other branch of knowledge in the universities, are subversive. I would go further, and argue that it is only by recognizing and embracing the subversive nature of their craft that humanists can avoid the new, deeply threatening &lt;em&gt;trahison des clercs&lt;/em&gt;, to borrow the title of Julien Benda’s famous pamphlet, toward which the market forces of the global village almost inexorably push us all. Almost inexorably, but perhaps not quite: if the historian (even the historian of religion) is no prophet, she or he can never be sure that the claim of subversion will only remain a symbolic gesture of protest, done only for honor’s sake. It may also, perchance, hide the seed of a future rebirth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the modern university is a secular place: no theological presupposition, no religious limitation may regulate the questioning of scientists and scholars alike. This, we must reckon, creates a particular problem for the study of religion, a problem that cannot be easily dismissed, although it often goes unrecognized. Creating secular knowledge about the sacred is by no means an obvious task, even when one deals with societies far away from ours in either time or space. Nor is the study of religion, despite appearances, perceived as a problem only by those who have religious leanings, and who may feel that their world, their values, are under attack, perhaps even desecrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I have come to realize over the years, creating secular knowledge about the sacred is also felt as a threat by the secularists, those who feel enlightened, free from the prejudices and fears so characteristic (they think) of religion. The modern, comparative study of religion is a study of humans, not of gods. More precisely, it is the study of humans dealing with the gods. It is, therefore, more akin to anthropology than to theology. While the study of religion cannot protect religion from the secular invasion (indeed, it reflects and often represents this invasion), it also refuses to evacuate religion from the secular world. In its double movement, the study of religion thus antagonizes both the proponents of a religious worldview and those of a secular one, appearing to both as a threat. No surprise, then, if it is deeply unfashionable. At the same time, it is urgently needed, as it stands at the very core of Faculties of Humanities, encapsulating, as it were, the duty of subversion that is theirs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, after the last Paris terrorist massacres, a dear friend of mine from Berlin expressed her shock at the speed with which French politicians were switching to a warlike vocabulary. The reticence to speak of war is easily understandable, and highly commendable, certainly on the side of Germans, who can afford historical amnesia even less than others. My immediate reaction to her remark, however, was that I had never considered the world I lived in to be a peaceful one. From the Qumran scroll describing the eschatological War between the Sons of Light with the Sons of Darkness and Mani’s &lt;em&gt;Sermon of the Great War&lt;/em&gt; to more recent bouts of religious violence, in Jamestown, Waco, Ayodhya, Bali, Beirut, New York, Ankara or Bamako, war has always been omnipresent. We know, moreover, that not all Sons of Darkness belong to the enemy camp; some also sit in our midst. For me, then, humanism is conceivable only in a world at war; it must be a fighting humanism. In his theses &lt;em&gt;On the concept of history&lt;/em&gt;, written in 1940, Walter Benjamin could say: “the emergency situation in which we live is the rule.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Ultimi barbarorum!” Spinoza’s cry of rage and despair, which he inscribed on a placard when hearing of the lynching of his friends, the De Witt brothers, in 1672, might have cost him his life, had not his lodger wisely locked him up in his room. “Ultimi barbarorum!” This cry resonates today in this impossible city, Jerusalem. Before the end of my first year of studies at the Hebrew University started the Six Day War – a war still going on, almost fifty years later. A life of learning and of teaching under such conditions is something difficult to grasp, and quite hard to sustain, as no university can remain an island of reason in a sea of madness, of honesty in a situation of injustice, certainly not when it stands, and quite concretely so, at the very seam between conqueror and conquered. We have tried seriously, students and teachers alike, to keep our labs, our libraries and our seminar rooms aseptic, as it were, to concentrate on what we were doing, isolated from the world looming right outside our window. &lt;em&gt;Wissenschaft als Beruf&lt;/em&gt;: we have done our best to take Max Weber’s injunction seriously. We have played by the rules of democracy, while a whole people was, and still is being kept under military occupation, without civil rights, now for almost half a century – deprived of its freedom by those whose children read about Israel’s Exodus from Egypt and the books of the prophets in the original biblical Hebrew! For many among us, this has been at times intolerably stressful, unbearably painful. At some point, the bow must break. Under some circumstances, it is in the mode of protest that the duty of the scholar must be expressed. Cultivating the humanities in such a climate does not necessarily entail the splendid isolation of a (more or less) air-conditioned ivory tower. It can also express a potent protest, represent, as it were, a subversive activity against the reigning order. I have long been impressed by what Raja Shehadeh, a Palestinian writer from Ramallah, has called &lt;em&gt;şumūd&lt;/em&gt;, a noble way of resisting daily brutality and the constant rape of the soul by stubbornly sticking to one’s beliefs, way of life, and ethos. Insisting on remaining oneself, on keeping high one’s torch of values in front of politicians lending their support to thugs, ‘thugs for God’s sake,’ one might call them, and transmitting this torch to the youth: there is a real element of subversion here, perhaps even, who knows, a powerful one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are left here with a theologico-political aporia rooted in the very nature of Zionism. Like all movements of national liberation, Zionism achieved its goals, at best, only very partially. Here, the founders of the Hebrew University were quite lucid, aware from the start of the deep-seated ambiguities of the adventure in which they were taking part. I shall mention here only Yehuda Leon Magnes, the first President of the Hebrew University, Martin Buber, the first President of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities, and Gershom Scholem, another President of this Academy. In his magnum opus, a biography of the seventeenth-century false messiah Sabbatai Zevi, first published (in Hebrew) in 1959, Scholem could warn of the explosive mixture of old messianic ideas and modern political ideals. Today, the dialectics of the return to Zion threaten to lead to what is perceived, by too many, as Israel’s ‘manifest destiny’: after the Reconquista of the whole land, the segregation into reserves of the Palestinians, or even their eventual expulsion. The supreme jewel in David’s crown, for them, would be the rebuilding of the Jerusalem Temple and, one imagines, the ensuing restoration of daily blood sacrifices (what else would one do in the Temple?), after a pause of a mere two millenia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is certainly important, and tragically fascinating, to study the sinuous paths through which religious tradition and cultural legacy can - and do - degenerate into such lunacy. This urgent task is that of historians of religion. But it is not our only task, nor is it our most immediate one. If we wish to avoid what might soon lead to nothing less than a conflict of world dimensions, we must also fight the present neo-messianic madness urgently, and furiously. When fair is foul, and foul is fair, civic courage meets intellectual duty, and intellectual courage means civic duty. The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, its Faculty of Humanities, and its students of religion, must be at the front line in this subversive war against the murderous folly threatening our society and our humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
