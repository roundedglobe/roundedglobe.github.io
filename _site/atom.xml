   <title>The Command Line</title>
   <link href="http://roundedglobe.github.io/the_command_line/"/>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Today Drew Holgate, co-founder of Rounded Globe, begins a series of occasional posts highlighting the significance of Linux, the free software movement, and other techy issues that the educated public should be aware of, but aren&amp;#39;t.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t you have to use the command line?&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Isn&amp;#39;t Linux a command line?&amp;quot; are concerns people often raise when thinking about switching to Linux.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they tend to be mollified with something like &amp;quot;No, you never need to touch the command line. You can do everything you&amp;#39;d do on any other computer without ever seeing the command line&amp;quot;. Which is perfectly true. But we see the unspoken question in their eyes; &amp;quot;If you don&amp;#39;t have to, then why on earth &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; you?&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They don&amp;#39;t actually ask it because they&amp;#39;re afraid we&amp;#39;ll talk more about Linux.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#39;s understandable, to their eyes the command line looks archaic — it&amp;#39;s what people used in the 70s and we&amp;#39;ve got &lt;em&gt;graphics&lt;/em&gt; now — why would you use something so &lt;em&gt;crude&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;illustration&quot;&gt;


&lt;a href=&quot;/images/the_command_line.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/the_command_line.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well it&amp;#39;s beautiful to &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you are using a computer you are communicating with it; you are telling it what you want it to do and it is telling you the results of what you asked. The Linux command line is a verbal language for communicating with your computer. Linux commands are words in a language, each embodying one idea. Like words in any language, they can be arranged into sentences of any length and complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose, for some reason, I wanted an ordered, uppercase list of all the most common words in this document I&amp;#39;m writing now. In English that would be &amp;quot;Produce a list of the thirty most common words in this document with a frequency count, order it by frequency and then alphabetically, convert the words to uppercase and then email me the list&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the language of the Linux command line that would be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;tr -d &amp;quot;\&amp;quot;,&amp;quot; &amp;lt; the_command_line.md | tr -cs &amp;quot;[:graph:]&amp;quot; &amp;quot;\n&amp;quot; | tr &amp;quot;[:lower:]&amp;quot; &amp;quot;[:upper:]&amp;quot; | awk &amp;#39;{h[$1]++}END{for (i in h){print i&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;h[i]&amp;quot;)&amp;quot;}}&amp;#39;| sort -nr -t$&amp;#39;(&amp;#39; -k2 -k1d | cat -n | head -n 30 | mailx -s &amp;quot;common words&amp;quot; uo.is.ou@gmail.com
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second later, &lt;a href=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/XCWUT0w.png&quot;&gt;the email arrives&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with any verbal language, you need to learn it before you can use it. But, like any language, you start small; first learning syntax and then filling out vocabulary. And of course there&amp;#39;s a command for finding out what each command means and how to use it — a combined dictionary and textbook of sorts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could save the above command, perhaps calling it &amp;#39;count2email&amp;#39;, and then it becomes a word I can use — I have coined a new word in the language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A graphical user interface only allows the user to perform the discrete set of tasks that the programmer has explicitly provided — an application can either do something (like emailing a list of all the commonly used words) or it can&amp;#39;t. The command line allows the user to tell the computer &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; what to do. It is precise, expressive and lends itself particularly well to complex or repetitive tasks. If I wanted my computer to, every third Tuesday, make a list of the most common words in the file I have written to most recently, overlay those words on a randomly chosen image of a kitten from the internet and then post that image to my website, I could do that. I don&amp;#39;t know why I&amp;#39;d want to, but I could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course there are certain tasks for which a graphical interface is better-suited. But for those where it&amp;#39;s not, using one is like trying to have a conversation with another human using only Pictionary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s why some people use the command line. Not out of necessity, but out of choice.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Chaucer Goes To The Golden Horde</title>
   <link href="http://roundedglobe.github.io/chaucer-goes-to-the-golden-horde/"/>
   <updated>2016-01-29T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://roundedglobe.github.io/chaucer-goes-to-the-golden-horde</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Today we publish a post by the historical novelist Bryn Hammond, whose &lt;a href=&quot;http://roundedglobe.com/book/54f6f692a26359d553f3348e/Voices%20from%20the%20Twelfth-Century%20Steppe&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Voices from the Twelfth-Century Steppe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is scheduled for publication by Rounded Globe on March 15, 2016.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;illustration smallimg left&quot;&gt;


&lt;a href=&quot;http://amgalant.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/800px-Diego-homem-black-sea-ancient-map-1559.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://amgalant.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/800px-Diego-homem-black-sea-ancient-map-1559.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Black Sea map 1559. Wiki Commons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chaucer set his &lt;em&gt;Squire’s Tale&lt;/em&gt; at ‘Sarray, in the land of Tartarye’ – that is, Saray, city of the Golden Horde Mongols, Jochi’s &lt;em&gt;ulus&lt;/em&gt;, above the Black and Caspian Seas. What did Chaucer know or care about a Tartar khan at Saray and his court?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Squire’s Tale&lt;/em&gt;, as a romance, has been despised in the past; people have said it’s unfinished either because Chaucer had too much discrimination to go on or because the other Canterbury pilgrims stopped the squire’s drivel. You can &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.librarius.com/cantales.htm&quot;&gt;read it yourself&lt;/a&gt; and judge. If you like medieval romances (adventure tales, with fantastic happenings, errant knights and wandering plots), there’s nothing wrong with it. It is unfinished, to the point that it’s only just begun. We are left with the khan’s daughter, gifted with a ‘quaint ring’ that lets her understand the talk of birds, having listened to the confession of a she-falcon, intent on self-harm, who has been seduced and left for a rival; the rest of the court are still asleep, after a grand feast whereat was given to the khan a flying horse of brass, that transports you anywhere when you tweak its ears. Nobody knows what happened next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;illustration smallimg right&quot;&gt;


&lt;a href=&quot;http://amgalant.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/1024px-Flying_Horse_East_Han_Dynasty.Bronze._Gansu_Provincial_Museum.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://amgalant.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/1024px-Flying_Horse_East_Han_Dynasty.Bronze._Gansu_Provincial_Museum.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It used to be dismissed as a mishmash of wild marvels ‘for those who like that sort of thing’. Who knew that the &lt;em&gt;Squire’s Tale&lt;/em&gt; had historical value? Carmel Jordan told the world in 1987 when she consulted archaeological work written in Russian, and saw that the Golden Horde was as spectacular as Chaucer describes (you can take &lt;a href=&quot;http://ibnbattuta.berkeley.edu/6goldenhorde.html&quot;&gt;a little trip&lt;/a&gt; with Ibn Battuta, to visit the khan in his gold-tiled tent in 1332-3). The setting, at least, wasn’t wild imagination; and furthermore, she suggests that every marvel had its real-life kick-off: the bronze horse, for instance, might have been put into Chaucer’s head by gift steeds that caused a stir at Mongol courts for their unusual size and general foreign glamour. The khans had a fascination with contrivances, too, that might inspire Chaucer’s magical ornamentation: the ingenious silver tree that dispensed drinks at Karakorum had its counterpart in Saray.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;illustration smallimg left&quot;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chaucer, unfortunately, never set foot in Saray himself or indeed the Golden Horde. How did he come to be informed? In the latter 13th and the 14th centuries, near the end of which the &lt;em&gt;Squire’s Tale&lt;/em&gt; was written, the khans of Saray and the Italian merchant republics operated in a symbiosis, for an unprecedented age of trade. Genoese, above Venetians, won the major part of the Black Sea trade, and moved with confidence in the Mongol world. Genoa also outstripped other Italian cities in trade relations with England. Chaucer took part in a delegation to Genoa for trade discussions in 1372-3; subsequently he was employed in Customs for the port of London. It is agreed he had ample opportunity, in diplomatic and commercial circles, to hear from Genoese their tales of Saray.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently Michael Murrin has written a great book on &lt;em&gt;Trade and Romance&lt;/em&gt;: how romance, first turned by Marco Polo’s travels, changed from a ‘Celtic fantastic’ to a ‘marvelous real’ – set in Asia, and driven not by the interests of aristocratic fighting men, although these remain the heroes of romance, but by the adventurous activities of merchants. He posits a dual audience for such romances as the Squire’s Tale, both upper class and those who live by commerce. It is the case that fighting men didn’t visit Saray: merchants did (not that these merchants weren’t up for a fight). Merchants went further, and saw things undreamt of by knights. The popular romances followed in their steps – but doing this, they lost status, and were trivialised, too, in the scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m fascinated by Chaucer’s trip of the imagination to Saray, and later adventures too of European romancers in the Mongol world. More to come on my own blog, &lt;a href=&quot;http://amgalant.com/&quot;&gt;Amgalant&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Grand Challenges For Archaeology</title>
   <link href="http://roundedglobe.github.io/grand-challenges-for-archaeology/"/>
   <updated>2016-01-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://roundedglobe.github.io/grand-challenges-for-archaeology</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Michael E. Smith&amp;#39;s post is part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dougsarchaeology.wordpress.com/2016/01/01/the-grand-challenges-for-archaeology-a-blogging-carnival/&quot;&gt;Grand challenges for archaeology blogging carnival&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do archaeology in order to learn about the past. This is a pretty broad purview. We learn about an amazing variety of past things from archaeology, from Richard III’s posture to the causes of the Maya collapse, from what the Natufians ate for breakfast to how the Plains peoples hunted bison. We work hard to recover treasure, garbage, dirt, tools, cathedrals and latrines, and we use them to make statements about what happened long ago. We ask all sorts of questions: Whodunnit? What the heck is that? Why is this particular coin sitting in that specific layer? What were they thinking?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do archaeology for many diverse purposes, from reconstructing the lives of ancient kings and queens to creating historical narratives, from helping communities reconstruct their past to complying with government regulations. In this essay I will discuss one of those purposes—creating reliable information about past human societies. This is the primary goal of the archaeology I do, and to my mind this is the most important contribution archaeology makes to human knowledge. Another way of saying this is to claim that archaeology is a social science (Smith et al. 2012). That is, we contribute to the stock of knowledge about human societies around the globe and into the past. Our special brand of knowledge is distinctive in several ways that most of us can rattle off easily. We have access to human societies not documented by any other discipline (e.g., Natufian society). We can study change over longer periods of time than can historians. And we learn about aspects of past societies that cannot be studied well by other fields (e.g., material culture).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade I have become involved in several transdisciplinary research projects. I have learned to interact with scholars in other disciplines (including geography, planning, sociology, political science, economics, and physics), and I have had to read widely in disciplines far outside my comfort zone of archaeology and anthropology. These experiences have made me simultaneously optimistic and pessimistic about the ability of archaeology to generate reliable information about past human societies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My optimism has several components. First, our findings really do stand out as unique and important in bringing to light societies not accessible in any other way. I take examples from comparative urbanism, one of my research foci. Archaeology now describes quite a few fascinating and unique past cities and urban traditions—huge dense Tripolyan settlements (urban or not? How did so many Neolithic people live together?); the low-density urbanism of Mesoamerica, Africa and Asia (how did these cities work in a jungle setting?); or Çatalhöyük. Second, archaeology really does produce unique and important data—even on “historical” societies. No other discipline can study past settlement patterns, and archaeology has an incredible record of data on settlement sizes in many past regions. Third, a growing number of scholars in other disciplines actually take archaeological findings seriously and want to engage with archaeologists to learn more and to use our data. I am still surprised at this situation. Prior to going interdisciplinary ten years ago, my colleagues in cultural anthropology rarely expressed any interest at all in archaeology or my research. Now I interact with scholars in different disciplines who think our data can contribute to their research agendas. Amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I am also depressingly pessimistic about whether archaeological data can really contribute to social science knowledge and research beyond a couple of small projects here and there. Another way of putting this is to say that I think it will be hard to respond adequately to the many “grand challenges” to archaeology identified by Kintigh et al. (2014a, 2014b) until this higher-order challenge is pursued (click &lt;a href=&quot;http://publishingarchaeology.blogspot.co.il/2014/01/the-grand-challenges-for-archaeology.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for my take on those earlier grand challenges). This is my grand challenge here—to make the effort to change many entrenched archaeological practices to allow us to create reliable knowledge about past societies. We do good fieldwork, and our methods are constantly improving. We have access to a growing suite of sophisticated analytical techniques. But the results of our fieldwork and analysis are not yet building a solid foundation of evidence and data about past societies. Why not?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;two major roadblocks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our data are not available; and, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our epistemology is inadequate, particularly in the areas of theory and argument.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;(1) Our data are not available&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “gray literature” of unpublished and poorly available contract archaeology reports is a vast sink of archaeological data. Some of it is reported in formats that can be used by other scholars, and some is not. Some is posted online, much is not. There is more contract archaeology going on around the world than grant-funded academic research, yet most of the results contribute little or nothing to building a systematic foundation of knowledge about the past. This needs to change. There are far too many academic archaeological research projects that are never adequately published, leaving important artifacts moldering in a dusty lab or analyzed data locked up in individual idiosyncratic data formats. And even archaeological data from projects that are published can be difficult to access; we need datafiles—not printed tables of numbers—and more excavation photographs—not the few that made it into the report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is getting uncomfortably personal now. My current project will be published and the data archived on tDAR before too long (I hope!). But the primary data for my earlier projects are sitting in ring binders, negative holders, a bunch of Excel and Access databases, and my own head. Should I start another fieldwork project, or spend my time archiving old data? The former is more fun, but perhaps the latter is of greater value to the discipline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge here is to change the behavior of individuals (like me) and to promote institutional solutions that will make our data available. Even when data ARE available, they will often need cleaning and sorting and recoding if we are going to compare our data to social science data about the present (Smith 2010). Creating and using data archives is a big part of this challenge, and that is why &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tdar.org/about/&quot;&gt;archives like tDAR&lt;/a&gt; are so important. But a change in the culture of archaeology may also be required. When an economic historian publishes a study that uses quantitative data, the datafiles are regularly posted and made available for others to use and reanalyze. Could anyone reanalyze my data that way? Not yet. We don’t have a culture within archaeology that promotes the easy sharing of data. A change in these norms would be a big improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;(2) Our epistemology is inadequate&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Archaeology is a science, in the standard social-science conception of science as having these traits:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowledge is responsive to evidence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Claims are exposed to challenge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Findings should be internally coherent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arguments should be judged on the basis of explanatory power, generality, simplicity, and replicability. For discussion of these traits, see: Gerring (2012) or Wylie (2000).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of my colleagues who view archaeology as a branch of the humanities, or who are hostile to science for reasons postmodern or other, please ignore the following discussion; it does not apply to you. But if one accepts the notion that archaeology does indeed (or can) conform to the model of science as outline above, then one has to be depressed about the current state of archaeological epistemology. Propositions are rarely tested, claims are too infrequently challenged, and formal arguments are rarely examined for adequacy. I explore this situation and provide suggestions for improving our arguments in Smith (2015). One result of our sloppy epistemology is that we have failed to create a solid body of empirical knowledge that can be improved, refined, and extended as research proceeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When postmodernism hit the social sciences in the 1980s, disciplines such as sociology and political science gave it a look, made a few changes, and got back to work. But in anthropology or archaeology, postmodernism settled in as a systemic infection and pushed empirical, scientific approaches to the margins. In the archaeology of complex societies, postmodernism is still festering (post-processualism, post-structuralism, post-humanism, etc.). The assumptions of postmodern approaches contradict the principles of science as listed above. Postmodern approaches are incapable of testing empirical propositions or carrying out rigorous comparative analysis. This is not just my peculiar view of the world; this is basic social science epistemology, discussed in a rather extensive literature rarely considered by archaeologists (6 and Bellamy 2012; Gerring 2012; Hedström 2005; Mjøset 2001; Tilly 1994, 2008).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although few archaeologists use the phrase “postmodern” these days, this anti-science perspective is rampant in the discipline. As noted by a noted postmodern geographer, scholars now prefer to use the term “post-structuralism” because it is a “safer sounding label” than postmodernism (Soja 2001:11863). A major goal of scholarship from this perspective is to deconstruct or problematize knowledge. That is, the idea is to break down established knowledge. In science, on the other hand, the goal is to build and extend reliable bodies of knowledge. In several blog posts—see &lt;a href=&quot;http://publishingarchaeology.blogspot.co.il/2012/01/rejected-by-science_27.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://publishingarchaeology.blogspot.co.il/2012/06/science-type-1-vs-science-type-2.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;—I have discussed two types of “science” in archaeology. Science type 1 is research with a scientific epistemology as discussed here. Science type 2 is work in an interpretivist or non-scientific framework that employs scientific techniques from other disciplines as part of the research process. Archaeologists pursing this model can sometimes fool scientific granting agencies by touting their use of archaeometry or “archaeological science,” while hiding the fact that their research is governed by a non-scientific epistemology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only research carried out with a scientific epistemology, making rigorous empirical arguments about data and about the past, serves to build a body of archaeological knowledge that is capable of generating reliable conclusions about past human societies (beyond descriptions of individual sites or finds). The prevalence of non-scientific epistemologies in archaeology (all the “post-“ approaches) makes it difficult to create this reliable knowledge. Yet for many of us, the goal of our work is to say something useful about past human societies. As in the case of the first roadblock—data availability—the promotion of a scientific epistemology will require a change in the culture of archaeology. If we want to contribute to a body of empirical evidence about human societies and their change over time, then we have our work cut out for us. If we fail to meet this &amp;quot;grand challenge,&amp;quot; then it is hard to see how we can meet all the other grand challenges identified by Kintigh et al. (2014a, 2014b) and by the other bloggers participating in this event.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Origins Of British Agriculture</title>
   <link href="http://roundedglobe.github.io/origins-of-british-agriculture/"/>
   <updated>2016-01-22T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://roundedglobe.github.io/origins-of-british-agriculture</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The first of a series of posts by Dr Mark McKerracher on the origins of agriculture. Subsequent posts will be published in this blog from time to time...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A relative of mine asked me how agriculture came about in the first place. It’s a fair enough question. We’re all so familiar with the concept of farming, that it’s hardly obvious how our distant ancestors moved from hunting and gathering to tilling the hateful earth. Indeed, I don’t (yet) have an answer to my relative’s question, but I thought I should start putting one together. And to avoid anything so strenuous as making a plan, I’ve decided to write these “Origins” in the order that things come to my attention, rather than the order in which they happened… not least because the chronology of early farming might prove to be a little tricky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, what better place to start than Britain itself, home to this blogger, and subject to a recent article in that venerable warhorse &lt;em&gt;Antiquity&lt;/em&gt; (Stevens &amp;amp; Fuller 2012). This article begins by claiming to rewrite the early history of Britain – no small claim! And as a bonus (for me), it’s written by two archaeobotanists, so how could I resist reviewing it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the uninitiated, it’s worth stating at the outset that we’re talking here about the Neolithic – the ‘new’ stone age, between about 6,000 and 4,000 years ago, a period which is broadly characterized by the widespread adoption of both farming and, increasingly, sedentary settlements. So how did this major change occur, and how quickly? As Stevens &amp;amp; Fuller describe, previous scholarship can be roughly divided into ‘abrupt’ and ‘gradual’ models. In the former case, the Neolithic starts with an agricultural bang; in the latter, agriculture is gradually adopted more and more from the later Mesolithic, through the Neolithic, and into the Bronze Age (pp.707-8). So what happened in Britain? And how on earth can we find out?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stevens &amp;amp; Fuller’s favoured approach is thoroughly &lt;em&gt;archaeobotanical&lt;/em&gt;: that is, they study the remains of ancient plants – specifically, the charred remains of cultivated and wild food plants. Fortunately, organic remains such as these can often be radiocarbon-dated, and the authors have compiled an impressive database with hundreds of dated items from Mesolithic, Neolithic and Bronze Age excavations in Britain. Basically, they chart the occurrence of crops (especially cereals) over time, and compare it to that of wild food plants (especially hazelnuts, which survive in particular abundance).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this way, they find some intriguing patterns. Firstly, Britain’s first domesticated crops seem to appear pretty early in the Neolithic, soon after 4,000 BC, with a relatively rapid uptake across the British Isles. Secondly, however, the occurrence of crops – relative to wild food plants – apparently tails off around 3,300 BC. In other words, their database has few if any dated crop remains for the ‘Middle’ and ‘Late Neolithic’, while hazelnuts continue to occur throughout these periods. Cereals don’t make a comeback until the Middle Bronze Age (around 1,500 BC).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stevens &amp;amp; Fuller therefore conclude that cereal-farming, although introduced in the Early Neolithic, was then abandoned during the millennia that witnessed the construction of monuments including Stonehenge. Only in the Middle Bronze Age did cereal-farming really set in for good. The  abandonment coincides broadly with some other perceived archaeological patterns: population decline and monument construction (including Stonehenge). By way of explanation, the authors suggest that &lt;em&gt;climatic deterioration&lt;/em&gt;, causing a run of bad harvests, may have led to the abandonment of early cereal-cultivation. But palaeoclimatology can be a rather slippery subject so, as usual, I’ll tip-toe carefully around it…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not a prehistorian, so I don’t feel qualified to comment too specifically on this paper. But I did find it fascinating. A relatively simple methodology (collecting figures and tracing patterns) has shown intriguing, unexpected results. This aspect particularly appeals to me, because it’s not unlike my own research. Archaeobotany so often languishes in specialist appendices of site reports with little attention to its (potentially very great) significance, so it’s pleasing to see plant remains taking centre stage in this article. But as the authors stress in their conclusion, the result is a very broad picture – broad in terms of geography and chronology – and of course it’s possible that the overall patterns may change considerably as more data become available. Even so, perhaps my favourite conclusion is this one (p.720):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…the paper demonstrates the limitations of using traditional period divisions and highlights the need to escape the tyranny of the ‘Neolithic’ label, and its assumption of unchanging village farmers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good point well made. I like period divisions as much as the next archaeologist – but we shouldn’t let them get the upper hand! Food for thought indeed…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MJM.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Can&#39;t Disrupt This</title>
   <link href="http://roundedglobe.github.io/can't-disrupt-this/"/>

   <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Elsevier and the 25.2 Billion Dollar A Year Academic Publishing Business&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twenty years ago (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scribd.com/doc/292346391/Forbes-Elsevier-1995&quot;&gt;December 18, 1995&lt;/a&gt;), Forbes predicted academic publisher Elsevier’s relevancy and life in the digital age to be short lived. In an article entitled “The internet’s first victim,” journalist John Hayes highlights the technological imperative coming toward the academic publisher’s profit margin with the growing internet culture and said, “Cost-cutting librarians and computer-literate professors are bypassing academic journals — bad news for Elsevier.” After publication of the article, investors seemed to heed Hayes’s rationale for Elsevier’s impeding demise. Elsevier stock fell 7% in two days to $26 a share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the smoke settles twenty years later, one of the clear winners on this longitudinal timeline of innovation is the very firm that investors, journalists, and forecasters wrote off early as a casualty to digital evolution: Elsevier. Perhaps to the chagrin of many academics, the publisher has actually not been bruised nor battered. In fact, the publisher’s health is stronger than ever. As of 2015, the academic publishing market that Elsevier leads has an annual revenue of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stm-assoc.org/2015_02_20_STM_Report_2015.pdf&quot;&gt;$25.2 billion&lt;/a&gt;. According to its 2013 financials &lt;a href=&quot;http://poeticeconomics.blogspot.co.il/2014/03/elsevier-stm-publishing-profits-rise-to.html&quot;&gt;Elsevier&lt;/a&gt; had a higher percentage of profit than &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2013/10/28Apple-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-Results.html&quot;&gt;Apple, Inc.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Schmitt1.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brian Nosek, a professor at the University of Virginia and director of the Center for Open Science, says, “Academic publishing is the perfect business model to make a lot of money. You have the producer and consumer as the same person: the researcher. And the researcher has no idea how much anything costs.” Nosek finds this whole system is designed to maximize the amount of profit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I, as the researcher, produce the scholarship and I want it to have the biggest impact possible and so what I care about is the prestige of the journal and how many people read it. Once it is finally accepted, since it is so hard to get acceptances, I am so delighted that I will sign anything — send me a form and I will sign it. I have no idea I have signed over my copyright or what implications that has — nor do I care, because it has no impact on me. The reward is the publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nosek further explains why researchers are ever supportive by explaining the dedicated loyal customer base mantra, “What do you mean libraries are canceling subscriptions to this? I need this. Are you trying to undermine my research?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to a steadfast dedication by researchers, the academic publishing market, in its own right, is streamlined, aggressive, and significantly capitalistic. The publishing market is also more diverse than just the face of Elsevier. Johan Rooryck, a professor at Universiteit Leiden, says, “Although Elsevier is the publisher that everybody likes to hate, if you look at Taylor &amp;amp; Francis, Wiley, or Springer they all have the same kind of practices.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heather Morrison, a professor in the School of Information Studies at the University of Ottawa, unpacks the business model behind academic publisher Springer and says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look at who owns Springer, these are private equity firms, and they have changed owners about five times in the last decade. Springer was owned by the investment group Candover and Cinven who describe themselves as ‘Europe’s largest buy-out firm.’ These are companies who buy companies to decrease the cost and increase the profits and sell them again in two years. This is to whom we scholars are voluntarily handing our work. Are you going to trust them? This is not the public library of science. This is not your average author voluntarily contributing to the commons. These are people who are in business to make the most profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should a consumer heed Morrison’s rationale and want to look deeper into academic publishers cost structure for themselves one is met with a unique situation: the pricing lists for journals do not exist. “It’s because they negotiate individually with each institution and they often have non-disclosure agreements with those institutions so they can’t bargain with knowing what others paid,” says Martin Eve, founder of the Open Library of the Humanities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to a general lack of pricing indexes, the conversation around the value of a publication is further complicated by long-term career worth. David Sundahl, a senior research fellow at the Clayton Christensen Institute for Disruptive Innovation, says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We actually understand how money passed through to artists who wrote music and authors who wrote books — but it is not clear how the value of a publication in a top tier journal will impact someone’s career. Unlike songs or books where the royalty structure is defined, writing a journal article is not clear and is dependent not on the people who consume the information but rather deans and tenure committees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Schmitt2.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Disruption Doable?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is precisely the prior lack of a pricing and value barometer that leads to the complexities associated with disrupting the main players in academic publishing. “Adam Smith’s invisible hand works to lower prices and increase productivity but it can only do so when valuation or pricing is known and the same thing is true for disruption. If you don’t know how to value something, you actually don’t have tiers of a market,” says Sundahl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a disruptive force was to significantly change academic publishing it needs to happen in a market that is currently underserved or undesirable by the large-scale publisher. “Disruptive innovation is usually driven by a group who can’t afford to build something that is as big, fancy and sophisticated as the existing solution — they then have to find a market where either people don’t have anything available to them or they are satisfied with something less than perfect,” says Sundahl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should academic scholarship keep existing in a similar trajectory as in the past decades Sundahl finds incumbents (existing big publishers) almost always win when competition takes place along those sustaining strategy lines. “To revolutionize academic publication, a new system would need to be developed in a basement market which would eventually enable people to gain enough credibility doing this new solution. People would then begin to value this lower end, well done research, and that is when the world starts to change,” says Sundahl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prior is exactly what large entities like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation or perhaps even top tier research one (R1) universities can’t do. “They have to play the game the way the winners are already playing it. Incumbents almost always win under those conditions,” says Sundahl. And to further complicate matters, junior colleges and community colleges, which perhaps would represent fertile grounds to be served by a newer, “basement market” entrant, may be less likely to spearhead this new outlet themselves due increasing government constraints focused nearly exclusively on job placement and starting salaries in lieu of a research-based, theoretical curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Open Access Packs a Punch&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Driven by the lopsided power structure the move toward open access and the unrestricted access to academic information has been exponentially growing. Perhaps it is, itself, a “basement market” for leveling the academic publication environment and creating a market where respect and credibility can be fostered, grown and transitioned into the existing academic prestige, merit, and tenure conversations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The open access environment is one of the more fertile environments for people to be thinking: if we don’t like the old way, what should the new way look like,” says Heather Joseph, executive director at the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC). Joseph finds that the quantifiable numbers of open access journals speak for themselves and says, “You can look at the number of strictly open access journals if you look at the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ). When it started tracking open access journals there were a few dozen and now they list over 10,000 open access journals.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The push toward open access is not only growing in sheer numbers of journals but also in an increasingly confrontational strategy that academics leverage against large publishers. “At the moment, the Netherlands, the whole country, has said to Elsevier that we want all of our researchers to be able to publish open access in your journals at the same rates we would pay for a subscription last year and if you can’t do that we’re going to cancel every one of your journals, for all of our universities nationwide,” says Eve. “They have a few days left to resolve this, and it looks like they are going to cancel all the Elsevier journals.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rooryck found his recent very public decision to step down and move his Elsevier journal Linga to open access met with complete support from the other six editors and 31 editorial board members. “The process went very easily. We were all aware of the pricing and Elsevier’s practices and within a week everyone agreed to resign,” says Rooryck. Eve’s platform, the Open Library of Humanities, will now house the new open access iteration of Lingua, which will be called Glossa. Eve says, “Right away it is 50% cheaper to run it through us then when it was with Elsevier. So anybody subscribing to it already sees 50% more revenue.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rooryck finds the move toward broad open access a natural progression and says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The knowledge we produce as academics and scientists should be publicly available in the same way we have a company that delivers water to our faucets and electricity to our home. These are things we have a right to. Public knowledge and education is a human right and it should not come with a profit tag of 35%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it appears open access has the ability to simultaneously diffuse academic knowledge to a larger body of readers and cut costs significantly, many feel that the for profit academic publishers are still situated to continue into the near future. Joseph says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the play for most smart commercial publishers is to try to preserve the current environment for as long as they can: delay the policy changes, delay the culture changes and to be working on things like tools and services applying to aggregation of data, where they are then embedding themselves more deeply in the workflow of researchers and becoming essential to researchers in a different way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are no longer essential to researchers in the, ‘you have to publish in my journal in order to get tenure and promotion’ what do they replace that with? I think the smart publishing companies like Elsevier, like Springer, who are very smart in that regard, have been thinking about where they can go to be playing a role of continuing to be seen as essential by the research community once they are no longer playing the role of providing assessment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Onward and Upward&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In the US Congress we have been finally making &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.sciencemag.org/policy/2015/07/senate-panel-approves-public-access-bill&quot;&gt;progress&lt;/a&gt; with the Fair Access to Science and Technology Research (FASTR) bill. It moved through the committee it was referred to in the Senate and is poised to move out of the Senate and potentially be considered by the House and hopefully pass. Ten years ago, I would have said we didn’t have a chance to do a stand-alone bill,” says Joseph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the recent congressional support Joseph refers to is one more verifying measure that the majority of articles will be moving toward an open and accessible framework. Many in the academic community hope that this government support signals the reprioritization of a research framework and the switching of the guard. And while the prior is extremely important, others in the academic community are hoping to grow “basement markets” from the ground up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Center for Open Science, which provides seed funds to startups in the academic scientific research space, is led by Nosek and focuses on aligning scientific values to scientific practices. “The open science framework is just a means at connecting all the research services that researchers use across the entire research life cycle,” says Nosek.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nosek is optimistic about the evolution of technology in open science and says, “There are a lot of startups going at different parts of the research life cycle. Whether it is publication and what a publication means, or looking at full articles and whether you can make articles convey information in smaller bite size pieces.” Nosek tells me that there are so many solutions happening in research right now and mentions it is hard to judge what the true solutions will look like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sometimes think some of the ideas haven’t a chance, but what do I know? I could be completely wrong about it. And that is the whole point — do some experimentation and try out ideas. And the fact is there are a lot of people who see what the problems are and have a unique sense of a potential solution — it is a very lively time to try out different answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time will tell if open access will be the needed disruption to allow the academic environment to right itself or if a new market emerges from startup incubators like the Center for Open Science. Regardless of how the future vision is realized, most in the academic community hope that the new iteration of scholarly articles and publishing will do more good toward humankind than that of a hefty profit margin.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A View From Jerusalem</title>
   <link href="http://roundedglobe.github.io/a-view-from-Jerusalem/"/>
   <updated>2016-01-08T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://roundedglobe.github.io/a-view-from-Jerusalem</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Welcome to the Rounded Globe blog! Our first post is an abridged version of Prof. Guy Stroumsa&amp;#39;s closing remarks at a conference held in Jerusalem earlier this month (January 2016). A scholar of comparative religion, Professor Stroumsa discussed the duty of scholarly subsversion. Speaking from the heart of a conflict, Stroumsa calls on intellectuals to step beyond aseptic seminar rooms into the wider world around them: a call to which we at Rounded Globe are deeply sympathetic.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, a &lt;em&gt;révolutionnaire manqué&lt;/em&gt;, the comparative study of religions and their cohort of dreams of transformations, of patterns of mutations, both within societies and inside the self, has always represented a deeply subversive activity. I wish to offer here a midrashic reflection of sorts on subversion as an intellectual and moral duty: that of refusing to lie on the Procrustean beds prepared for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the last half-century, the Hebrew University has been a true home for me, one which I never really left. A &lt;em&gt;witz&lt;/em&gt; describes psychoanalysts as people whose analysis was not quite successful: they were not able to move ahead. &lt;em&gt;Mutatis mutandis&lt;/em&gt;, the same could be said about professors and their education. The very first day of my new life in Israel, in July 1966 (I was eighteen, as old as the country), was also that of my baptismal day as a student at the Hebrew University – more precisely, at its summer Ulpan: the early stages of my interminable struggle with Hebrew. Like other ambitious universities, the Hebrew University has always known that its first, absolute commitment was to the search for truth and to what it entails: critical thought, moral backbone, intellectual freedom. The intellectual audacity expected from universities is worthless without the civic courage to constantly question thought patterns and attitudes current in their own societies, to affirm, clearly and loudly, their autonomy and independence from the bodies and governments funding them. In Rabelais’ lapidary dictum: “Science sans conscience n’est que ruine de l’âme.” This permanent questioning is, precisely, their duty of subversion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, paradoxically, universities are everywhere under threat, asked to ‘be relevant,’ rather than to search for truth, to ‘deliver’ rather than to educate. I say paradoxically, as human societies, despite blatant, shocking inequalities, have never been as affluent as they are today. I cannot analyze this paradox here or even attempt to suggest solutions. I want at least to stress what you all know, that Faculties of Humanities are much more seriously threatened that those of Sciences and vocational schools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The natural sciences have an easier time, I think, in their rebuttal of utilitarian demands, as it is relatively simple for them to show the value of pure research: no applied mathematics or physics without pure mathematics and physics. At least in theory, one can still make an argument about &lt;em&gt;la science pour la science&lt;/em&gt;, as one does about &lt;em&gt;l’art pour l’art&lt;/em&gt;. A similar argument is far less obvious for the humanities. Very soon, one will hear the argument about what the Germans call the &lt;em&gt;kleine Fächer&lt;/em&gt;, the “small fields,” such as, at least in the Israeli context, the paradigmatic Assyriology: too expensive, too few students. And besides, who cares about Assyriology?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem, I fear, is made more complex by the fact that the humanities, the &lt;em&gt;Geisteswissenschaften&lt;/em&gt;, in their wish to be taken seriously, have calqued themselves on the &lt;em&gt;Naturwissenschaften&lt;/em&gt;. They are still doing that, as shown by the latest fad, “digital humanities,” and by the widely spread tendency to value only what can be quantified. I am all for the use of modern technologies in the service of the humanities, but at the moment, the technologies seem to take over the fields rather than serve them. Faculties of Humanities risk forgetting that their task, beyond producing new knowledge, also consists in offering a reflection on knowledge, on its conditions, its limits and its meaning. Such a second-order reflection is essentially subversive, as it questions the natural acceptance of existing conditions for the reproduction of knowledge in society, including in its educational institutions, and in the political system sustaining them. The humanities are deeply unsettling, and therefore, in this age of increasing resistance to questioning, increasingly unfashionable. By historicizing and relativizing all ideas and world-views, they disturb what is held sacred in all quarters. It is, then, by nature that the humanities, more than any other branch of knowledge in the universities, are subversive. I would go further, and argue that it is only by recognizing and embracing the subversive nature of their craft that humanists can avoid the new, deeply threatening &lt;em&gt;trahison des clercs&lt;/em&gt;, to borrow the title of Julien Benda’s famous pamphlet, toward which the market forces of the global village almost inexorably push us all. Almost inexorably, but perhaps not quite: if the historian (even the historian of religion) is no prophet, she or he can never be sure that the claim of subversion will only remain a symbolic gesture of protest, done only for honor’s sake. It may also, perchance, hide the seed of a future rebirth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the modern university is a secular place: no theological presupposition, no religious limitation may regulate the questioning of scientists and scholars alike. This, we must reckon, creates a particular problem for the study of religion, a problem that cannot be easily dismissed, although it often goes unrecognized. Creating secular knowledge about the sacred is by no means an obvious task, even when one deals with societies far away from ours in either time or space. Nor is the study of religion, despite appearances, perceived as a problem only by those who have religious leanings, and who may feel that their world, their values, are under attack, perhaps even desecrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I have come to realize over the years, creating secular knowledge about the sacred is also felt as a threat by the secularists, those who feel enlightened, free from the prejudices and fears so characteristic (they think) of religion. The modern, comparative study of religion is a study of humans, not of gods. More precisely, it is the study of humans dealing with the gods. It is, therefore, more akin to anthropology than to theology. While the study of religion cannot protect religion from the secular invasion (indeed, it reflects and often represents this invasion), it also refuses to evacuate religion from the secular world. In its double movement, the study of religion thus antagonizes both the proponents of a religious worldview and those of a secular one, appearing to both as a threat. No surprise, then, if it is deeply unfashionable. At the same time, it is urgently needed, as it stands at the very core of Faculties of Humanities, encapsulating, as it were, the duty of subversion that is theirs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, after the last Paris terrorist massacres, a dear friend of mine from Berlin expressed her shock at the speed with which French politicians were switching to a warlike vocabulary. The reticence to speak of war is easily understandable, and highly commendable, certainly on the side of Germans, who can afford historical amnesia even less than others. My immediate reaction to her remark, however, was that I had never considered the world I lived in to be a peaceful one. From the Qumran scroll describing the eschatological War between the Sons of Light with the Sons of Darkness and Mani’s &lt;em&gt;Sermon of the Great War&lt;/em&gt; to more recent bouts of religious violence, in Jamestown, Waco, Ayodhya, Bali, Beirut, New York, Ankara or Bamako, war has always been omnipresent. We know, moreover, that not all Sons of Darkness belong to the enemy camp; some also sit in our midst. For me, then, humanism is conceivable only in a world at war; it must be a fighting humanism. In his theses &lt;em&gt;On the concept of history&lt;/em&gt;, written in 1940, Walter Benjamin could say: “the emergency situation in which we live is the rule.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Ultimi barbarorum!” Spinoza’s cry of rage and despair, which he inscribed on a placard when hearing of the lynching of his friends, the De Witt brothers, in 1672, might have cost him his life, had not his lodger wisely locked him up in his room. “Ultimi barbarorum!” This cry resonates today in this impossible city, Jerusalem. Before the end of my first year of studies at the Hebrew University started the Six Day War – a war still going on, almost fifty years later. A life of learning and of teaching under such conditions is something difficult to grasp, and quite hard to sustain, as no university can remain an island of reason in a sea of madness, of honesty in a situation of injustice, certainly not when it stands, and quite concretely so, at the very seam between conqueror and conquered. We have tried seriously, students and teachers alike, to keep our labs, our libraries and our seminar rooms aseptic, as it were, to concentrate on what we were doing, isolated from the world looming right outside our window. &lt;em&gt;Wissenschaft als Beruf&lt;/em&gt;: we have done our best to take Max Weber’s injunction seriously. We have played by the rules of democracy, while a whole people was, and still is being kept under military occupation, without civil rights, now for almost half a century – deprived of its freedom by those whose children read about Israel’s Exodus from Egypt and the books of the prophets in the original biblical Hebrew! For many among us, this has been at times intolerably stressful, unbearably painful. At some point, the bow must break. Under some circumstances, it is in the mode of protest that the duty of the scholar must be expressed. Cultivating the humanities in such a climate does not necessarily entail the splendid isolation of a (more or less) air-conditioned ivory tower. It can also express a potent protest, represent, as it were, a subversive activity against the reigning order. I have long been impressed by what Raja Shehadeh, a Palestinian writer from Ramallah, has called &lt;em&gt;şumūd&lt;/em&gt;, a noble way of resisting daily brutality and the constant rape of the soul by stubbornly sticking to one’s beliefs, way of life, and ethos. Insisting on remaining oneself, on keeping high one’s torch of values in front of politicians lending their support to thugs, ‘thugs for God’s sake,’ one might call them, and transmitting this torch to the youth: there is a real element of subversion here, perhaps even, who knows, a powerful one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are left here with a theologico-political aporia rooted in the very nature of Zionism. Like all movements of national liberation, Zionism achieved its goals, at best, only very partially. Here, the founders of the Hebrew University were quite lucid, aware from the start of the deep-seated ambiguities of the adventure in which they were taking part. I shall mention here only Yehuda Leon Magnes, the first President of the Hebrew University, Martin Buber, the first President of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities, and Gershom Scholem, another President of this Academy. In his magnum opus, a biography of the seventeenth-century false messiah Sabbatai Zevi, first published (in Hebrew) in 1959, Scholem could warn of the explosive mixture of old messianic ideas and modern political ideals. Today, the dialectics of the return to Zion threaten to lead to what is perceived, by too many, as Israel’s ‘manifest destiny’: after the Reconquista of the whole land, the segregation into reserves of the Palestinians, or even their eventual expulsion. The supreme jewel in David’s crown, for them, would be the rebuilding of the Jerusalem Temple and, one imagines, the ensuing restoration of daily blood sacrifices (what else would one do in the Temple?), after a pause of a mere two millenia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is certainly important, and tragically fascinating, to study the sinuous paths through which religious tradition and cultural legacy can - and do - degenerate into such lunacy. This urgent task is that of historians of religion. But it is not our only task, nor is it our most immediate one. If we wish to avoid what might soon lead to nothing less than a conflict of world dimensions, we must also fight the present neo-messianic madness urgently, and furiously. When fair is foul, and foul is fair, civic courage meets intellectual duty, and intellectual courage means civic duty. The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, its Faculty of Humanities, and its students of religion, must be at the front line in this subversive war against the murderous folly threatening our society and our humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
