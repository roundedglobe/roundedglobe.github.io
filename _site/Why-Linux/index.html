		<div id="postcontent"><h2>Long live the PC</h2>

<p>A popular narrative in the computing world for many years has been that the desktop PC is dead. There&#39;s some truth to that; it&#39;s certainly the case that mobile devices make up a large and growing proportion of computer use and that the sale of desktop PCs (which in this context includes laptops) has been in a slow decline for years.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a half-truth, though. PC sales have been in decline largely because computers last us longer — for numerous reasons the rapid increase in speeds and capacities began to slow about a decade ago and, as a result, there&#39;s less impetus to upgrade so often. And most mobile users are new users, people who did not previously do much, if any, computing.</p>

<p>There are certainly some for whom a mobile device has replaced a desktop PC or laptop but they are relatively few. Those of us for whom a computer is a work tool rather than just a communication device — those of us who <em>make stuff</em> — still need a PC and will for the foreseeable future. We can&#39;t get long-form writing, programming, photo editing, graphic design, music production, video editing or data analysis done on a tablet or smartphone.</p>

<h2>Proprietary motivations</h2>

<p>The primary concern of proprietary, commercial software vendors is not to make the best product they can, it&#39;s to make as much money as possible — a tech company that&#39;s not growing rapidly is seen as failing. Where competition exists this is fine; in a perfect world the superior product will sell the most. Unfortunately, in many realms of computing, there is no competition. Microsoft attained a 90% share of desktop operating systems in 1995 and have maintained a virtual monopoly ever since. Similar monopolies exist in graphical production with Adobe&#39;s Photoshop and Illustrator, in word processing and office work with Microsoft&#39;s Office products and in virtually every other area of computing.</p>

<p>When a software product is dominant, its authors no longer need to improve it — innovation is risky and R&amp;D is extremely expensive and difficult to justify to shareholders. Instead they utilise lock-in, forced obsolescence and anti-competitive business practises to maintain their advantage.</p>

<p>Lock-in describes any practise designed to make switching to a competing product difficult. An example of this would be Microsoft&#39;s proprietary document formats which are not primarily designed to be good document formats, they&#39;re designed to be difficult for third party applications to read. If you wanted to view a .docx file then, until quite recently, you <em>needed</em> to use Microsoft Word.</p>

<p>And these formats change. The new version of Office will have a new version of .docx — it doesn&#39;t introduce new functionality, its purpose is to break compatibility with older versions. No matter how much you want to stick with the old Office, eventually someone will send you a newer document than your version can handle and you&#39;ll have to upgrade.</p>

<p>Anti-competitive business practises include a wide range of strategies, chief amongst which are simply <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mergers_and_acquisitions_by_Microsoft">buying up and shutting down the competition</a>, using <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiKRt3-FbM0">software patents</a> to stifle competition and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend_and_extinguish">&quot;Embrace, Extend, Extinguish&quot;</a> approach.</p>

<h2>Mobile and spying</h2>

<p>Apple demonstrated with their iPhone quite how much money there was to be made with mobile devices. At the same time, Google were making huge profits harvesting users&#39; data and selling it to advertisers. Microsoft, their business perceived as flagging despite their desktop dominance, were listening.</p>

<p>Windows 8 and later 10 are Microsoft&#39;s attempt to get into the mobile market. Intended as an operating system to work on both mobile devices and desktop PCs, Windows 8 &amp; 10 represent what is known as &#39;convergence&#39; — the idea that one user interface should be used on all devices and from-factors — an approach Apple are also adopting in recent versions of their own desktop operating system, OSX.</p>

<p>This leaves desktop PC users who need to get actual work done with an interface not really designed for them. We&#39;ve gone beyond software vendors simply not improving their software to, from the perspective of a desktop user with work to do, its actually becoming <em>worse</em>. </p>

<p>Like Google, Facebook and others&#39; online services, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_10#Privacy_and_data_collection">Windows 10 collects a great deal of data on its users</a>. Exactly what is collected, to what purpose it might be put and who owns information collected about the user is far from clear — it&#39;s collected simply because it&#39;s valuable. The popular aphorism usually used to describe services like Facebook applies equally to recent proprietary operating systems: You are not the customer, you are the product.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/the-nsa-files">Snowden Revalations</a> illustrated beyond any reasonable doubt that the US and UK governments (amongst others) are engaging in mass surveillance and collection of citizens&#39; internet activities and communications, both meta-data and content, and that they are doing so with the help of all the major proprietary technology companies.</p>

<p>While many shrug this constant, pervasive surveillance off as an inevitable part of modern life — &quot;if you&#39;ve got nothing to hide then you&#39;ve got nothing to fear&quot; — for those who believe in the value of free expression and <em>free thought</em>, living in a virtual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panopticon">panopticon</a> with its associated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilling_effect">chilling effects</a> <em>must</em> be a concern. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcSlowAhvUk">Privacy matters</a> not because we want to hide things but because <strong>intellectual freedom is necessary to real progress</strong>.</p>
